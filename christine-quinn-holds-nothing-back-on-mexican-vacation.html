of.</p><p>Quinn was <a href=#>spotted</a> with her husband Christian Richard in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on January 9.</p><p>The 34-year-old realtor stunned photographers in a leopard-print bikini as she showed off her insane figure and golden tan by the pool of her private villa.</p><p>To top off the ideal holiday paradise, her villa overlooks the Instagram-worthy Sea of Cortez.</p><p>Christine is arguably one of the most entertaining members of the Selling Sunset cast.</p><p>Her unbothered attitude and passion for stirring drama make the show worth the watch, and her desire to wear the skinniest pencil heels has many viewers worried she’ll stumble during a viewing.</p><p>No stranger to drama herself, Christine spoke honestly about the traumatic experience of watching season 4 of the reality series after undergoing an emergency C-section.</p><p><strong>“Reliving the trauma on Selling Sunset about my birth experience, was one of the most difficult things I have ever done; let alone allowing these very raw, personal moments of my life captured on camera,”</strong> she shared in a <a href=#>caption </a>written for her son’s two-month birthday.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Bit About Christine Quinn</strong></h2><p>Christine was born in Dallas in October 1988 and had dreams of becoming an actress before finding her calling as a realtor.</p><p>She attended the Juilliard School in New York City and had big plans to become Hollywood’s next star.</p><p>Quinn had a series of minor roles in her brief acting career, acting in films like Hot Tub Time Machine 2, Shark Night, and The Perfect Match.</p><p>She also had several guest-starring roles in big-name TV shows, including Angie Tribeca, Ballers, NCIS: Los Angeles, and Drop Dead Diva.</p><p>Christine did not stop there, turning to modeling and making appearances in magazines such as Vogue.</p><p>She earned her <a href=#>real estate</a> license in 2016 and joined the Oppenheim Group that year.</p><p>Christine had no idea her fame would skyrocket after Netflix came calling.</p><p>During season 3 of the show, Christine announced her engagement and marriage to millionaire software engineer Christian Richard.&nbsp;</p><p>The show detailed their early courtship, providing viewers with an intimate look into their house-hunting process.</p><p>Christine was understandably upset when her on-screen gothic fairytale wedding was overshadowed by Chrishell’s divorce from Justin Hartley in the season 3 finale of the show.</p><p>She claimed she was promised a series of scenes going through the wedding and that Netflix used her perfect day as background noise.</p><p>She gave birth to the couple’s son in May 2021, who they named Christian Georges Dumontet – known as Baby C.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Christine Quinn: The Villain Of </strong><strong>Selling Sunset</strong><strong>?</strong></h2><p>Christine became a household name when Selling Sunset became the lockdown sleeper hit nobody expected.</p><p>When <a href=#>Chrishell Stause</a> joined the group in 2019, neither Christine nor her colleagues expected their lives to make it to the spotlight overnight.</p><p>According to Christine, the show’s editors make sure she is the sole antagonist when it is pretty straightforward all the women find something to scrutinize.</p><p>Known for her no-nonsense attitude, many fans have repeatedly singled her out for being the most entertaining member of the team.</p><p>When walking the red carpet at the People’s Choice Awards on December 7, 2021, Christine embraced her title as the villain of the show.</p><p>When <a href=#>asked </a>by Laverne Cox about her involvement in drama, she quoted RuPaul’s Drag Race star Scarlet Envy’s infamous TikTok audio:</p><p><strong>“Do I think I’m the drama? I don’t think I’m the drama. Maybe I’m the drama.”</strong></p><p>Christine added: <strong>“Yeah, I live for it. I love being the villain and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</strong></p><p>While fans agree that Christine is perhaps less manipulative than Davina Portraz, it is clear she adores stirring the proverbial pot.</p><p>In season 4, it seemed that the Selling Sunset ladies just had to add fuel to an already chaotic fire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Christine’s Traumatic Season 4 Experience</strong></h2><p>Christine opened up about suffering from postpartum depression during the filming of Selling Sunset’s fourth season.</p><p><strong>“I was pregnant on top of dealing with postpartum depression … this season was really difficult for me,”</strong> she <a href=#>said</a>.<strong> “I did the best that I could with the emotions that I was dealing with at the time and that I’m still dealing with now.”</strong></p><p>Quinn also came under fire after coworkers and viewers questioned her ability to gain her supermodel body right after she gave birth.</p><p>Christine revealed that she heard medical staff declare she needed an emergency C-section to save the baby during the difficult labor.</p><p>She also revealed that her husband was told to choose between his wife or son amidst the chaos.</p><p><strong>“[Christian] was absolutely freaking out. And then when we were doing the emergency C-section, my heart rate was going down, the baby’s heart rate was going down,” </strong>Christine told her colleagues on the show.<strong> “And then one of the nurses went up to Christian and said, ‘You need to make a priority right now. You have to choose one.’ He was like, ‘Both. You need… Both.’”</strong></p><p>Despite the show she has experienced as a new mother, Christine has had to fight rumors of faking her pregnancy online.</p><p>She revealed in a confessional that she wanted to maintain her physical health during her pregnancy, keeping her body active through yoga and pilates.</p><p>Accusations that she fabricated the entire pregnancy began to circulate after clips of the show in which Christine was being complimented on her post-baby body went viral.</p><p>In response to a scene that made it look like Christine was doing yoga after having just given birth, she revealed it had been edited to look that way.</p><p>According to Christine, the editors intentionally made it seem as though she was post-partum while she was exercising while pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I never worked out after my C-section,” </strong>she replied to a user on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.<strong> “Are you smoking Crack? Where did you read that? The yoga scene I was pregnant. It took me 4 months till I could even start yoga again.”</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, it seems as though Netflix took advantage of Christine’s fragile state when editing the series, painting her as a negligent mother and friend.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyZo7JuvdSipadlo6nCr7%2BO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gloria-trevi-net-worth-how-much-is-trevi-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gloria Trevi Net Worth How Much is Trevi Worth?</a>
