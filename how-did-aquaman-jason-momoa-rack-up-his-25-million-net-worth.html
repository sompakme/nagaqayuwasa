Much of that monetary success is a result of Momoa having a hold in the DC Extended Universe as Aquaman. A role that garnered him $7 million for 'Aquaman' but a whopping $15 million for the sequel.</p><p>In addition, Momoa has been in blockbusters like, 'Fast X', with 'Fast X: Part 2' in pre-production, making him a small fortune, not to mention it is rumored that Momoa will be starring in 'Minecraft' in the near future.</p><p>While his professional life is doing quite well, Momoa and his wife, Lisa Bonet announced that they were getting a divorce after 16 years together and five years of marriage. While there were rumors of a reconciliation, they proved to be incorrect with the two deciding to go their separate ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-momoa-39-s-security-job><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jason Momoa's Security Job</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar46278333-1.jpg><p>It was a struggle for Momoa early on, as he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to make ends meet by working a security job at a nightclub</a>. His gig to earn some extra cash entailed telling bar-goers to keep it down while in the parking lot, due to the fact that the bar was located in a residential area.</p><p>"The worst job that I had was working as security," Momoa explained. "At the time, I was living out of an Airstream, but it got really hard, and I couldn’t live in it anymore. I ended up living on my friend’s couch, putting the Airstream into storage, and borrowing money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-momoa-39-s-appearances-on-baywatch-hawaii-and-stargate-atlantis><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jason Momoa's Appearances on Baywatch: Hawaii and Stargate: Atlantis</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jasonmomoa.jpg><p>Let’s just say Momoa’s future in acting didn’t get off to the most promising start, as he showed up to the Baywatch audition with absolutely nothing on his resume.</p><p>“When I was in Hawaii I went to a casting call for Baywatch Hawaii – it was basically like a cattle call for 1,300 people," Momoa explained via Square Mile. "I got there, and seven hours later when I finally got to the front of the line, they said, 'Oh, you’ve got to have a resume.' I was like, 'Oh yeah, well, I don’t have one.' They were like, 'Dude, have you ever acted?' I was like 'No.'"</p><p>Ultimately, Momoa made up the fact that he had gone into modeling, just so he could have something on his resume.
