This is because the science of attraction has something to do with the sense of smell; it is the first thing a person notices about the opposite sex but it is hardly noticeable. When it comes to women being attracted to men, his smell is what will get her hooked. And since men are known to sweat 50% more than women do, it is necessary that a man smells good in order to attract the right partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perfume and cologne are two different things but achieve the same purpose. There is no truth to whether men are more suited for cologne compared to perfume because it is about body chemistry and how it reacts with the fragrance. There are some colognes that have the word “sport” attached to it and that is one example of how the perfume or cologne was designed for men who still want to smell good while they exercise or who sweat often.</p><p>Smelling good is definitely a priority, especially those who want to find a suitable partner - so when it comes to finding the finest scents, some men would spend a lot of money just so they could smell their best.</p><p>These are the top 10 most expensive perfume for men:</p><h2 id=10-serge-lutens-borneo-1834-cologne-for-men-135><b>10. Serge Lutens’ Borneo 1834 Cologne for Men ($135)</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is considered as one of the best colognes for men. It began as a perfume that suited both men and women. It has a warm and spicy scent that comes from cardamom, patchouli, French labdanum, cocoa, white flowers, and galbanum. It is the combination of patchouli and cocoa that makes this scent interesting. Due to these two ingredients, there is a pleasant confusion that satisfies the senses.</p><h2 id=9-eau-de-vert-eau-de-parfum-spray-by-miller-harris-142><b>9. Eau de Vert Eau de Parfum Spray by Miller Harris ($142)</b></h2><p>Eau de Vart is an energizing, unisex scent as it opens with citrus notes. It develops into a mature character thanks to the marjoram and geranium. Its freshness can suit both men and women but is more suited to men because of its sharp scent. As it develops, there is a sweet musk that reveals itself.</p><h2 id=8-l-eau-serge-lutens-150><b>8. L’eau Serge Lutens ($150)</b></h2><p>This is a perfume that makes men smell fresh and crisp. Its scent reminds one of freshly pressed linens or a white soap bar fresh out of its box. Its scent has hints of citrus mixed with magnolia, lily of the valley, rose, and amber. The aldehyde is a great addition to this scent, too. When it comes to smelling simple, fresh, and clean, this one is a great choice.</p><h2 id=7-straight-to-heaven-by-kilian-225><b>7. Straight to Heaven by Kilian ($225)</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Straight to Heaven is one of the most popular scents for men and that might be thanks to rum. That’s right, rum was the inspiration behind this fragrance. It is a woody and spicy fragrance mixed in with a bit of musk, jasmine, patchouli, Virginia cedar, amber, nutmeg, vanilla, and of course, rum! The fragrance is known for lasting a long time, too. This scent is known for reminding people of the warmth of the tropics. Men have also received lots of compliments just by wearing this fragrance that is also known as White Cristal.</p><h2 id=6-clive-christian-1872-310><b>6. Clive Christian 1872 ($310)</b></h2><p>This is the best known luxury perfume brand. One of its best selling men’s fragrances is 1872. It has a strong citrus scent with a tinge of spice. What makes this scent so well-loved is the way it was prepared. It follows old perfume tradition of using ingredients that are strictly vegetable in order for the fragrance to last hours long.</p><h2 id=5-clive-christian-c-perfume-375><b>5. Clive Christian C perfume ($375)</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was an original scent for women but perhaps the British company decided they would give men an equal chance of smelling just as fresh. The difference compared to the women’s scent is that the greener smell is stronger than the lemon, jasmine, rose, and amber scents. It is said that it was meant to complement the women’s scent that when a man and a woman wear both scents, the fragrances will develop within 24 hours.</p><h2 id=4-ambre-topkapi-610><b>4. Ambre Topkapi ($610)</b></h2><p>Ambre Topkapi is one of the most expensive cologne for men. It is very strong at the beginning but the more it lasts, the more the spices blend into a fresh and woody scent. The master perfumer behind this is Pierre Bourdon and he decided to mix in strong spices like bergamot, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg with grapefruit, pineapple, and lavender. There’s no wonder this fragrance is woody, spicy and fresh!</p><h2 id=3-annick-goutal-s-eau-d-hadrien-1-500><b>3. Annick Goutal’s Eau D’Hadrien ($1,500)</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not all perfume for men smell musky, woody, or spicy; a fresh citrus fragrance can suit a man just as well. Annick Goutal’s Eau D’Hadrien smells of a ripened fruit thanks to the Tuscan Sun. This fragrance was created as an expression for Goutal’s love for Tuscany and the hints of cypress and different citrus fruits is great on the skin.</p><h2 id=2-caron-s-poivre-2-000><b>2. Caron’s Poivre ($2,000)</b></h2><p>This is a unisex fragrance that has been around since the 1950’s. Though there has always been much debate on whether it is more suited for men than women and vise versa. Once again, it is about body chemistry. The fact is it has been around since 1954 and is still selling despite its hefty price tag. Its scent is explosive and intense as it begins with spicy and peppery notes but then develops to a floral scent.</p><h2 id=1-clive-christian-no-1-pure-perfume-for-men-2-350><b>1. Clive Christian No. 1 Pure Perfume for Men ($2,350)</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is the most expensive bottle of men’s perfume in the world. Aside from being made from some of the rarest ingredients that are from different parts of the world, it is packaged in a bottle made from crystal and its neck is made of gold. If that isn't luxurious enough, then it should be known that there is a five karat diamond included in the gold inset. Originating from the late 1800’s, its stopper is designed just like the original pattern which was granted by her majesty herself, Queen Victoria. This perfume not only makes a man smell terrific, it makes him feel royal, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9Oop2ZpYGK6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGannqqWqrqmv4yipWasmJp6uLvRpZtmnp%2Bneq6xzWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./10-of-mayim-bialik-s-parenting-styles-we-would-try-10-we-would-not.html>&#171;&nbsp;10 Of Mayim Bialik's Parenting Styles We Would Try (10 We Would Not)</a>
