Fans had a blast with the story, as Grohl gave the details about his experience at Paul McCartney's party. As expected, it was an A-list guest list featuring the likes of Taylor Swift as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grohl promised himself that he'd only stay until 10 PM, given that he had to drive his kids to the bus stop the next day. However, things took a turn once the party started. Things were getting exciting at 10 PM, so Grohl decided to stick around.</p><p>Things did take a bit of a turn when Grohl was asked to play the piano, or perform something. Grohl was very nervous given that he had one too many drinks. The artist recalls the experience, “He started playing this song and he’s blowing everyone’s mind. A new Paul McCartney song – weird! He finishes, and everyone looks at me, and they’re like, ‘Go on, Dave, play a song!’</p><p>“I’m like, ‘I don’t know how to play piano.’ I look around and all the guitars are left-handed. I’m screwed.” He added: “I’d maybe smoked a little pot – so I was already ‘challenged.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift completely saved Dave Grohl</a>, asking to play something herself. Hilariously, she played one of Grohl's classics, but the artist just couldn't piece it together, “It’s like one of those nightmares where you’re running backwards, always late,” he said. Then it struck him: “I know this song. What the hell is this? And she was playing Best Of You. As if I weren’t high enough – that blew me into outer space! Taylor Swift, Best Of You, Paul McCartney… I lost my mind.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Handled The Boos At Her Friend's Wedding In The Best Way Possible</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, that's a moment Grohl won't ever forget, and he'll always be thankful for Swift sticking up for him and saving the day.
