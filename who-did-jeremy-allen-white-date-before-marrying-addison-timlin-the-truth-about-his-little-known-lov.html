He has always made it clear that he is incredibly passionate about acting. And it seems like he is truly doing what he has been born to do. While some people dabble in acting because they're chasing fame, that's definitely not Allen White. It actually seems that he would probably rather not be a well-known figure at all. But, of course, he's so good at what he does that he has a huge fanbase now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-often-does-jeremy-allen-white-see-his-kids_-here-s-the-truth-about-his-life-after-his-secret-divorce-from-addison-timlin.jpg><p>When he starred in the popular TV series as Lip Gallagher, he dated Emma Greenwell, who played Lip's crush and neighbor Mandy Milkovick. PopSugar reported that they split up in 2014 and began acting together in 2011. The actual dates of their relationship aren't known. But sometimes actors have so much chemistry on set that they explore their connection of screen and that's what happened here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/emma-greenwell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Shameless is all about the Gallagher family who struggle every day of their lives, the show also had some dramatic romances. Lip and Mandy had one of the most talked about love stories. It wasn't entirely surprising to find out that Allen White and Greenwell were dating in real life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Ebon Moss-Bachrach And Jeremy Allen White’s Relationship While Filming The Surprise Hit Foodie Series The Bear</a></span></p><p>Since fans don't even know that much about Jeremy Allen White and Addison Timlin's relationship, it makes sense that not much is known about his time with Emma Greenwell.</p><p>Emma Greenwell seems to be just as private as Jeremy Allen White. When they were together, the couple didn't talk about it. And now that they have been broken up for a while, they haven't mentioned their time together in interviews. Greenwell keeps a much lower profile than her famous ex. While the success of The Bear keeps Allen White in the public eye, she hasn't starred in any movies or TV shows that have really taken off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jeremy-allen-white-emma-greenwell.jpg><p>In May 2021, the actress shared a wedding photo on her Instagram account and wrote in the caption "I wish I could marry you everyday."

It was only when he received a Golden Globe Award for The Bear in 2023 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen White mentioned Timlin in his speech</a>. Before that, he hadn't talked much about his then-wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jaw-instar.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No one is sure if Jeremy Allen White dated anyone before Emma Greenwell. Because the now 32-year-old actor was 20 when he began starring on Shameless and then dated Greenwell, it's possible to guess that he had a few relationships during his high school years. Or maybe he was focused on the craft of acting instead and didn't want to date. While Allen White talks about realizing that he wanted to be an actor, he hasn't talked about other details of his teenage years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White Had Mixed Feelings About Emmy Rossum Leaving The Cast Of Shameless</a></span></p><p>The actor seems to love any chance to talk about how much he enjoys his career. His acting is very important to him. And it definitely should be since he's so talented. He might think that people aren't actually that interested in who he's in love with. But, of course, he's a fascinating actor and fans would be happy to find out more about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2022 interview with Fault Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen White answered questions about his career</a> and didn't talk about his personal life. He said that when he was around 12, he realized that he liked to act. Before that, he danced and played various sports.</p><p>Allen White told Fault Magazine, "I found that I was able to focus while performing which is something that I found difficult to do especially as a child, even still to this day. Acting was something I was always aware of, it was something both my parents did, when they were in their 20s and 30s. They met in NY doing theater, there was always a passion for theater, film, and the art of acting in our household growing up."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jaw-instar-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Jeremy Allen White dates after his divorce, he will likely continue his tradition of staying private about it. And if he gets married again, he might still decide to mostly talk about his acting work. Allen White is such a charismatic and talented actor that it's hard not to wonder about his personal life. Right now, however, he is probably the most focused on his divorce, parenting his two kids, and the success surrounding his time on The Bear.
