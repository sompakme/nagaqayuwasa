Even if you have no interest in the fashion industry, this periodical has covered some of the biggest issues and controversies of modern age. It has made a huge impact on our society and the way that we look at the fashion industry as a whole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not just the magazine that is renowned, but the faces behind the magazine that have stood out as well. The Editor-in-Chief, <a title="Anna Wintour Net Worth" href=#>Anna Wintour</a> is a fashion mogul who has paved the way for many like her in the industry. She is known as strong and independent, but has let cameras go behind the scenes through documentaries such as The September Issue and see her at her most intimate moments. However, you can't think of Ms. Wintour and not think of the acclaimed book and movie The Devil Wears Prada, which is rumored to be written based on her industry reputation.</p><p>Then you have people such as Grace Coddington, the Creative Director of the magazine who has seamlessly pulled together the creative strategy that has made the magazine so well-known. There is nothing like it that exists anywhere in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every month, fashion lovers ponder over the question "who will be on the cover this month and why?" We almost always expect it to be a celebrity that is currently in the limelight, but Vogue always takes things a step further. There is always a reason that they person on the cover is there and Vogue captures them at their most important moments, making a statement month after month. Vogue is always ahead of the curve and you can bet that you will learn something important from whomever’s face graces the cover each month. They will be important, because Vogue says so.</p><h2 id=10-eyes-of-the-model-april-1954><strong>10. Eyes of The Model, April 1954</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/eyes-of-model.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This cover was done during a time when Vogue was a little bit different, as it was less about photoshop and more about actually making an artistic front cover. They created many covers using just drawings alone, and this one is so iconic because it mixed the two mediums to create something very original and unique. In modern day, we tend to focus more on who the person is on the cover and what they will be wearing and base the “wow” factor on those aspects, while back in 1954 they got people’s attention in other ways.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-helmut-berger-and-marisa-berenson-july-1970><strong>9.&nbsp;Helmut&nbsp;Berger&nbsp;and Marisa Berenson, July 1970</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SKMBT_C20310100810230.jpg><p>Photographed by David Bailey, this cover looks boring to say the least, but was momentous if you know the story behind the cover. Up until this point, this had been a predominantly geared towards women magazine, but when Helmut Berger appeared on the cover alongside Marisa Berenson in 1970, he was the first man to ever grace the cover of Vogue magazine. Since then, this decision has opened the doors and brought many huge figures such as <a title="Elton John Net Worth" href=#>Elton John</a> and Manolo Blahnik to the cover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-diana-princess-of-wales-august-1981><strong>8.

Throughout her life, Princess Diana was on the cover of the magazine for a whopping total of three times, this one in particular celebrating her engagement to <a title="Prince Charles Net Worth" href=#>Prince Charles</a>. The close up view of her face captured her striking beauty, while the inner pages included numerous mock ups of great designers pitching their ideas for her legendary wedding dress.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-model-cover-for-100th-anniversary-april-1992><strong>7. Model Cover for 100th Anniversary, April 1992</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vogue-models-100th-issue.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This well known cover featured ten of the most well recognized and established models in the world including <a title="Cindy Crawford Net Worth" href=#>Cindy Crawford</a> and <a title="Christy Turlington Net Worth" href=#>Christy Turlington</a>, among many others, who have all been featured in past covers of the magazine. It was highlighted with a white background and the models all dressed in white for this April issue that celebrated Vogue’s 100th anniversary in the most beautiful way imaginable. This image on the cover marked something very momentous for Vogue and they did it with many women who had been there through thick and thin with them along the way.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-gisele-bundchen-and-robbie-williams-october-2000><strong>6.&nbsp;Gisele&nbsp;Bundchen and Robbie Williams, October 2000</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/giselle-and-robbie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This cover was known for its scandal and shocked people when it hit newsstands in October of 2000. While it was old news at this point to see a man on the cover of Vogue magazine, seeing a naked man on the cover wasn't something America had accepted or been prepared for. Photographed with well-known model <a title="Gisele Bundchen Net Worth" href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a> as she wears a very indecent bathing suit bearing the British flag, the issue took an in depth look at the rising fame of rock star <a title="Robbie Williams Net Worth" href=#>Robbie Williams</a> as he traveled the globe.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-nicole-kidman-may-2004><strong>5. Nicole Kidman, May 2004</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Nicole-Kidman-hero.jpg><p>This glorious cover, shot by amazing photographer Irving Penn marked a time when old Hollywood glamor met modern day stars and captured that fashionable moment for one of the most purchased magazines in the world. Not to mention, that during this time –and now—<a title="Nicole Kidman Net Worth" href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> is considered Hollywood Royalty—one of the elite. The focus on the cover is her simplistic beauty and the complex design of the amazing dress she is wearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-lady-gaga-march-2011><strong>4.

Being known for her fashion forward thinking and extremely unconventional ways of dressing, this cover was monumentous. Instead of capitalizing on her avant garde style, they seemed to strip it all away and go with a simplistic style that caught people off guard and drew them towards this issue. They wanted to know about her as a person and take part in this powerful movement.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-michelle-obama-march-2012><strong>3. Michelle Obama, March 2012</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/article_photo1.jpg_full_600.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a title="Barack Obama Net Worth" href=#>Barack Obama</a> was elected president of the United States, it was a first for many things. Among many firsts, one of them was the first lady, Michelle Obama gracing the front cover of Vogue magazine. Since the Kennedy’s, it had been a while since we had a presidential couple in the limelight—treated almost as if they were celebrities, following their every move. Michelle proudly posed for the cover, as it bared the title “The First Lady The World Has Been Waiting For,” and told her story to the world. The cover showed Michelle in a different light and turned her into a person that women could relate to.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-lena-dunham-february-2014><strong>2. Lena Dunham, February 2014</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lena_dunham_vogue_cover.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking the world by storm with her no bull sh*t attitude and pure talent for writing, directing and producing her first ever television show (not to mention starring in it!) in HBO’s GIRLS, she truly dazzled us all with her wit and (most of the time) naked body. <a title="Lena Dunham Net Worth" href=#>Lena Dunham</a> is not your typical Hollywood actress, but she sucked us in with her raw manner that we were all instantly attracted to. Putting someone on the cover of Vogue magazine that is not your typical beauty queen let the world know that this seemingly prissy magazine was willing to go outside their comfort zone.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-april-2014><strong>1. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, April 2014</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kimkanye.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This cover was beyond popular simply because of the controversy that accompanied it. It became a media frenzy when rap star <a title="Kanye West Net Worth" href=#>Kanye West</a> befriended Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and she was spotted sitting front row at his New York City concert. Once he started dating reality star <a title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and they had a baby together, the rest went down in history.</p><p>It is said that Mr. West petitioned and pleaded for him and his bride to get a spot on the cover of this historical magazine…and he won! It was almost a spectacle in the media because so many people disagreed, not deeming them Vogue worthy. You be the judge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF51aierp1dmLy3sdGsZKieXZa5rXnToqSeZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-are-harry-styles-parents-inspiration-behind-his-success.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Are Harry Styles Parents?
