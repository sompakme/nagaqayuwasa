It's not uncommon for R&B singers to discover their love of music from church or return to church music after deciding to leave the secular world.

The boutique sells items such as jewelry, clothing, antiques, and perfumes.</p><p>Kline helped come up with the name, which referenced the blue trees in Fauvist paintings.

He also tried being a furniture mover, but he was in his 40s, and his back strength wasn't like it was before. It's unclear what Hayes is up to right now, but he is happy that Girlfriends came to Netflix.
