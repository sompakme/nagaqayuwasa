Daughter of former model Yolanda Hadid and sister to fellow models Gigi and Anwar Hadid, Bella clearly comes from the right stock to go down in modeling world history. Fans are obsessed with her striking look, often not realizing that her signature brown tresses are actually dyed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bella, who recently had <a href=#>her hair chopped, colored, and totally transformed on TikTok</a>, doesn’t usually rock her natural hair in public, and if you look through most of <a href=#>her jaw-dropping posts on Instagram</a>, it’s easy to assume that she’s a natural brunette. Luckily for curious fans, the supermodel has opened up about her reasons for coloring her hair in a few interviews! Keep reading to find out why she doesn’t flaunt her natural color and how she deals with comparisons to her sister Gigi.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Aren't Impressed With The Excuse Bella Hadid Gave For Her DUI</a></span></p><h2 id=her-natural-locks>Her Natural Locks</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’d be forgiven for thinking that Bella Hadid is a natural brunette. The model, <a href=#>who’s been named one of GQ’s Most Stylish Women of the Year</a>, pulls off the color so well and she’s been rocking it proudly pretty much from the second she stepped onto the scene. But in actual fact, the super model actually has naturally blond hair!</p><p>When you look at her mom, Yolanda, and her sister, Gigi, it’s not hard to believe that Bella naturally has fair locks. Although every now and then we have seen her with her natural hair, she seems to prefer to dye it darker. And according to Bella herself, there are a few reasons why!</p><h2 id=why-she-dyes-it>Why She Dyes It</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Allure, Bella Hadid revealed that she “didn’t want to be put in a box or be seen as a carbon copy of her sister.” As Cheat Sheet reports, this point of difference is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the main reason why she dyes it brunette</a>. As we know, Gigi is one of the most famous blondes on the planet!</p><p>It’s understandable that Bella would want a different look from her sister, as the media often likes to lump famous family members together or pit them against each other if they have too many similarities.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Bella Hadid Reveals The Insane Story Behind Her Cannes Red Carpet Look</a></span></p><h2 id=her-ldquo-dark-rdquo-personality>Her “Dark” Personality</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The point of difference isn’t the only reason why Bella opts for dark hair. She also reportedly feels like the brunette hair matches her personality better than blond hair. “I just have a darker personality,” she said (via Cheat Sheet).</p><p>She went on to describe the personality that she feels is attached to blond hair: “Blondes are so angelic. My sister can get away with anything … I’m not trying to be this cool girl. If you’re trying to be something you’re not, it’s slowly going to bite you in the butt.”</p><h2 id=just-wanting-brown-hair>Just Wanting Brown Hair</h2><p>Although Bella stated in the Allure interview that she doesn’t want to be a carbon copy of her sister, she also said in an interview with Glamour in 2016 that the real reason she dyes her hair brown is simply because she likes it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I started dyeing my hair when I was 14. I dyed it black and blue, I wore eyeliner—I was a punk kid. I might want to go blond eventually!"</p><p>With these conflicting interviews, it’s not totally clear whether Bella really is trying to separate herself from her sister. Either way, brunette locks totally suit her, even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she can also rock blond look amazing too</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bella Hadid Cries And Reveals The Less Glamorous Side Of Being A Model</a></span></p><h2 id=comparisons-with-her-sister>Comparisons With Her Sister</h2><p>Whether or not Bella feels pressure over Gigi comparisons now, she has opened up about experiencing such comparisons in the past. She revealed in an interview that she was self-conscious of her “big hips” during her teenage years and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">longed for Gigi’s more athletic build</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“'I love them now, but I was always self-conscious of my hips - whereas my sister had a six-pack and was very athletic. And I thought I had a weird face. I remember very distinctively getting bullied because of my features,” she said (via the Daily Mail).</p><p>Bella has also opened up about the differences between her and Gigi’s personalities, which have also been hard to deal with at times as they’ve both pursued modelling careers: “You know, my sister's very bubbly and very out there and I was always very reserved.”</p><h2 id=which-sister-modeled-first>Which Sister Modeled First?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being that she booked her first modelling job when she was just two years old, Gigi was the first Hadid sister to break into the industry. Years later, Gigi signed with IMG models in 2013 and her career soared soon after.</p><p>Bella signed with IMG models in 2016, once Gigi was already established, and actually had other plans for her career when she was growing up. She briefly attended the Parson School of Design in New York City to pursue a career in photography before dropping out to focus on her modeling career, which also soared to unprecedented heights.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans In Awe As Bella Hadid Slays At The Fendi Capsule Campaign</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahsGaalaG5onnHmpuinF2ZvKa%2Fza1kq6eToHqpsdFmpZqspaeurXnHmqCrZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./travis-barker-gets-barbed-wire-tattoo-at-the-dentist-pic.html>&#171;&nbsp;Travis Barker Gets Barbed Wire Tattoo at the Dentist: Pic</a>
