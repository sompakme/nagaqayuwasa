isn't easy. The child of a celebrity probably feels that early in life. Knowing a parent is a famous actor, or rock star, or legendary music producer, or renowned journalist could put incredible pressure on a kid. Some children of celebrities choose to live outside of the limelight. Some celeb kids try to make a name for themselves, but eventually fail. Then, sometimes celebrity kids become celebrities themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Are they following in their parents' footsteps? Yeah, sometimes. Some kids of actors become actors themselves. Then again, some become musicians. Some kids of musicians become actors instead. Fame isn't paint-by-numbers. There are many variables that go into making a career. It may help to have a famous parent to help get a kid's foot in the door. To last, they need passion and talent. It takes more than being a one-hit wonder or landing one major role to be a legitimate success.</p><p>Those kids who have multiple hit songs or blockbusters can outshine their celebrity parents one day. A few children come from families where both parents are or were celebrities. Some kids only have one famous parent. In other cases, the child has a celebrity parent, but wasn't raised by them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes celebrity kids find fame quickly. They become childhood stars (which may or may not cause issues down the road). On the other hand, some celebrity kids are late bloomers. They take time finding fame. Once they do, their path to greatness is undeniable. Regardless of the age they started making their mark, here are 10 celebrity kids who are going to outshine their parents and 10 who already have.</p><h2 id=going-to-colin-hanks>Going to: Colin Hanks</h2><p>When you're an actor and your father is an actor, there isn't a better role model than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hanks</a>. C'mon, who doesn't like Tom Hanks? Not only does the man playing Mr. Rogers seem like a good guy, he is an outstanding actor. Whether it's in terms of awards or box office numbers, Tom Hanks is the man. When he won back-to-back Best Actor Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, he became only the second man to do so. His films have also grossed more than $9.0 billion worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those are some large--probably comfortable and sensible shoes--to fill. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Hanks</a> hasn't reached that elite status yet, but one day he could. Check him out as Greg in the CBS sitcom Life in Pieces. He has impeccable timing and plays well off of the other actors. It's hard not to notice his voice and mannerisms are like his dad's, but that could act in his favor. Colin, who had major roles in Orange County, Roswell, FX's Fargo, and The Good Guys, seems to have Tom's acting range too.</p><h2 id=already-have-emma-roberts>Already Have: Emma Roberts</h2><p>At 27, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Roberts</a> has already outshined her father <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Roberts</a>. She has a long way to go to outshine her aunt Julia, but that is another story. Emma had her breakout role on Nickelodeon's Unfabulous as Addie Singer from 2004 to 2007. She appeared in movies such as Nancy Drew and Hotel for Dogs before taking on more adult roles in Scream Queens, We're the Millers, and three seasons of&nbsp;American Horror Story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eric isn't known for his acting chops. One magazine once claimed he was "out-acted by a CGI snake" in a TV movie. When a fake snake is considered better than a real actor, that's not good. It's safe to say Emma's a better actress than that. Eric started acting in 1977, but it has been a mediocre career at best.&nbsp;Substance abuse and run-ins with the law have hurt his career.</p><h2 id=going-to-dakota-johnson>Going to: Dakota Johnson</h2><p>As a child of a celebrity, it's hard enough to outshine one parent. Imagine having to outshine two. That's the case for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dakota Johnson</a>. She's the daughter of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melanie Griffith</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Johnson</a>.</p><p>Dakota Johnson, 28, became a well-known name as the female lead of the Fifty Shades series. Fifty Shades of Grey wasn't loved by critics for many reasons including a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lack of chemistry</a> between the stars. It was a box office smash though, earning over $571 million world wide.</p><p>It takes more than one commercially successful series to outshine Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, who have acted for almost 50 years. Griffith won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical for her role in Working Girl. Plus, Don Johnson played Sonny Crockett in the 1980s TV smash hit Miami Vice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It might take a few more years, but Dakota Johnson can eventually outshine her parents.</p><h2 id=already-have-jennifer-aniston>Already Have: Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>No disrespect to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Aniston</a>, but his daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>, outshined him years ago. If longevity was the criteria for this list, John would beat&nbsp;out Jennifer. However, by name recognition alone Jennifer wins. Diehard Days of Our Lives fans know John well. John's played the role of Victor Kiriakis since 1985, but he's not a household name like Jennifer's is.</p><p>Friends put Jennifer on the pop culture map in 1994. Women were even flocking to salons to get the "Rachel." She is still going strong 24 years later. Jennifer may have earned her comedic stripes as Rachel Green, but she has continued to have a successful career starring in some hilarious comedies. Movies like We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses, Wanderlust, Office Space, and Office Christmas Party show Jennifer at her best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=going-to-elle-king>Going to: Elle King</h2><p>Maybe there's no surer bet of a celebrity's kid to outshine his or her parent than Elle King. She's not there yet, but it won't take much more to surpass her celebrity father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Schneider</a>.</p><p>Wait, what? As surprising as it may be, the guy that played Deuce Bigalow fathered the singer of "Ex's and Oh's." Elle King's sultry bluesy voice pushed her to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart and earned her two Grammy nominations. She's just getting started.</p><p>Schneider played some memorable characters on Saturday Night Live and in numerous Adam Sandler movies. Unfortunately, he's had a few failed sitcoms and his body of work isn't highly regarded. However, the length of his career and some standout moments give him the edge. For now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=already-have-rashida-jones>Already Have: Rashida Jones</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rashida Jones</a> is another child of two celebrities. Her father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quincy Jones</a>, is a legendary music producer. Quincy has 28 Grammys and worked with Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra, and Celine Dion. Her mother, Peggy Lipton, won a Golden Globe for Best Television Actress in 1970 for her work in The Mod Squad. She was also in the original run of the amazingly freaky mystery horror TV show Twin Peaks.</p><p>In a way, these two careers cancel each other out. Quincy's career was iconic. Lipton's was respectable, but nothing remarkable. It leaves room for Rashida. She plays the lead role in the TBS police comedy Angie Tribeca. Add that to her roles on The Office, Parks and Recreation, I Love You Man, and Our Idiot Brother, and her comedic prowess is clear. What also helps Rashida, a Harvard University graduate, outshines her parents is&nbsp;her talent as a writer and director too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=going-to-bryce-dallas-howard>Going to: Bryce Dallas Howard</h2><p>Outshining an actor who played two iconic roles and is one of the most respected directors in Hollywood is nearly impossible. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Howard</a> played Opie on The Andy Griffith Show for eight years and Richie Cunningham on Happy Days for seven years. Later, he focused on being behind the camera. Ron has directed some of the most critically acclaimed movies of the past 25 years, such as Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, and Frost/Nixon. In 2001, he won an Oscar for Best Director for A Beautiful Mind.</p><p>While Ron's daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryce Dallas Howard</a> isn't outshining him yet, she has plenty of time to leave her mark. Her breakthrough roles came in M. Night Shyamalan's 2004 The Village. He cast her again in Lady in the Water in 2006. Bryce's career is more than appearing in twisty thrillers. Octavia Spencer served her a special slice of pie in The Help, she hung with Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 3, and ran from dinosaurs in Jurassic World with Chris Pratt.&nbsp;Look for more from her in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=already-have-drew-barrymore>&nbsp;Already Have: Drew Barrymore</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Barrymore</a>'s life hasn't been easy. The life of a child actor rarely is. Some can stay out of trouble, but Drew wasn't so lucky. At 7, she captured hearts as Gertie in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial in 1982. Only two years later, she started smoking cigarettes. Then came all the substance abuse,&nbsp;all before she turned 13.</p><p>Drew's father, John, struggled with a problem as well, but addiction wasn't the only thing in Drew's blood. So was acting. John's career was basically low-budget movies and sporadic TV appearances. Eventually, Drew turned her life around and became a box-office draw. Drew has easily outshined her father's career. Drew can act in serious movies, as she has shown such as in&nbsp;Poison Ivy&nbsp;and Donnie Darko. In comedies, like The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, and Fever Pitch, Drew proved she can also be a loveable leading lady.</p><h2 id=going-to-zoe-kravitz>Going to: Zoe Kravitz</h2><p>Being the daughter of a rock star and an actress has its perks. It also has its disadvantages, like trying to outshine them. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe Kravitz</a>, 29, is well on her way to one day surpassing the fame of her parents <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenny Kravitz</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Bonet</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zoe has been a part of highly regarded projects recently. She played Toad the Knowing in 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road, which was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Zoe was also in the acclaimed Big Little Lies on HBO. Her work as Christina in The Divergent Series has made her a recognizable face to many moviegoers.</p><p>Lenny also has experience playing a role in a film adaptation of a popular young adult series. He played Cinna in The Hunger Games Series. However, Lenny's best known for rockin' out with tunes like "Fly Away," "Are You Gonna Go My Way," and a cover of the Guess Who's "American Woman." Bonet is best known as Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show and its spinoff A Different World.</p><h2 id=already-have-ben-stiller>Already Have: Ben Stiller</h2><p>It's safe to say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Stiller</a> got his humor from his parents. His mom and dad, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Stiller</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Meara</a>, teamed to form a legendary comedy team in the 1960s. They definitely transferred some of their comedic talents to their son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Jerry's late-career resurgence as Frank Costanza on Seinfeld and Arthur Spooner on The King of Queens couldn't overtake Ben.</p><p>Ben has written, directed, produced, or starred in more than fifty films. He's known for comedies such as the Meet the Parents and Night at the Museum trilogies, Zoolander, DodgeBall, There's Something About Mary, and Tropic Thunder. Ben's movies have averaged $79 million per film in the United States and Canada.</p><p>Outshining legendary parents is nearly impossible, but Ben has based on his body of work.</p><h2 id=going-to-katie-cassidy>Going to: Katie Cassidy</h2><p>An actor/singer famous enough to have his own magazine is tough to outshine. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Cassidy</a>, who rose to fame on The Partridge Family, was a teen idol in the 1970s. The heartthrob's face was everywhere. His voice was familiar in songs like "I Think I Love You."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David's daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Cassidy</a> is also making a name for herself in Hollywood. She stood out in her role as Ruby on Supernatural. Katie's work on Arrow as Laurel Lance/Black Canary made her popular with fans of the show. With a mother who was a model and a father who had his face plastered over teenage bedrooms, Katie isn't short on looks either.</p><p>David, who died in November 2017 of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">liver and kidney failure</a>, was known mostly for one project. It made him a megastar. If Katie strings together more successful TV shows and movies, she can outshine her father.</p><h2 id=already-have-miley-cyrus>Already Have: Miley Cyrus</h2><p>"Achy Breaky Heart" made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Ray Cyrus</a> a household name in 1992. It's Billy Ray's most popular song. It reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it also is considered by some one of the worst songs ever recorded. The song linedanced its way to pop culture lore, which should be enough to outshine a celebrity child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a>. From 2006 to 2011 she was the star of the Disney Channel's Hannah Montana, which became one of the highest-rated shows on basic cable. After leaving the show, she ditched Mickey for molly. Her wholesome image vanished at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards after her shockingly memorable performance with Robin Thicke.</p><p>Miley's music also grabbed listeners' attention. She has nabbed nine top-10 songs on the Billboard Hot 100--including "The Climb," "Party in the U.S.A." "We Can't Stop," and "Wrecking Ball," which reached No. 1.</p><h2 id=going-to-scott-caan>Going to: Scott Caan</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Caan</a> has made a career playing criminals. His son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Caan</a>, has made a career catching them. Probably James' most (in)famous role is as hot-headed Sonny Corleone in The Godfather. James was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal.</p><p>Since 2010, Scott has booked bad guys as Danno on the reboot of the popular CBS cop show Hawaii Five-O. He also had roles in Entourage and the Ocean's movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scott is on his way to surpassing his dad's fame, but James' body of work is too strong. Playing memorable roles in movies like Brian's Song, <i>Thief</i>, Misery, and Elf give him the edge for now. Not to mention, James has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2 id=already-have-chris-pine>Already Have: Chris Pine</h2><p>Throughout his career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pine</a> has been cast to play new versions of old characters. He's played James T. Kirk in the Star Trek reboot series since 2009. He's also played CIA agent Jack Ryan, who was previously played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck.</p><p>Strangely, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> didn't play Sgt. Joseph Getraer in the 2017 reboot of CHiPs. Robert Pine, Chris' father, played that role in the original TV series, which ran from 1977 to 1983 on NBC. It was Robert's signature role. Since, he's had bit parts in TV shows like Knight Rider, Magnum P.I., Saved By the Bell, and Beverly Hills 90210.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Chris has starred in such movies as Unstoppable, Into the Woods, Hell or High Water, A Wrinkle in Time, and Horrible Bosses 2.</p><h2 id=going-to-josh-brolin>Going to: Josh Brolin</h2><p>Colin Hanks' real father already made the list. Now, so has his TV father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Brolin</a>. James may play Colin's dad in Life in Pieces. In real life, his son is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Brolin</a>.</p><p>Josh was in films like No Country for Old Men, True Grit, and Milk. In the Harvey Milk biopic, Josh picked up Oscar and SAG nominations for Best Supporting Actor. He is gaining more fame playing characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Josh has made two appearances as Thanos and is slated for at least two more movies. He also signed a four-film contract to be Nathan Summers/Cable in the upcoming&nbsp;X-Men film series.</p><p>Those roles may help Josh outshine his dad eventually. Looking at James' trophy case gives him the edge. His Emmy and Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actor for playing Dr. Steven Kiley in Marcus Welby, M.D. are tough to overcome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=already-have-charlie-sheen>Already Have: Charlie Sheen</h2><p>Not all of the light from celebrity kids outshining their parents is "good." Substances have been a serious problem for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Sheen</a>. Even so, he was having a decent career until an epic meltdown earned him more attention. Crazed rambling about tiger blood and "winning" in an interview got people talking. So did hooking up with various stars and a string of legal issues.</p><p>Before his meltdown, Charlie's career included movies like Major League, Platoon, Young Guns, Wall Street, and The Three Musketeers. On TV, he replaced Michael J. Fox on Spin City and gained popularity as Charlie Harper on Two and a Half Men. In 2010, he earned $1.8 million per episode for the show.
