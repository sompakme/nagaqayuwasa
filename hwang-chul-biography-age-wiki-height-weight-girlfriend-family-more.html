Later, in 2009, he brought his fitness career to the next level by entering bodybuilding competitions. Chul placed second in the lightweight division in his first game, the 2009 Musclemania World Championships.</p><p>He began competing regularly after that, gaining more size and strength each year until, by the end of 2010, he’d sculpted such an impressive physique that he earned the 2010 Musclemania World at Fitness America Weekend contest, winning his Pro Card as well.</p><p>Chul hasn’t slowed down since then, becoming a celebrity fitness trainer and appearing in a slew of Korean and American advertisements, TV shows, and magazines. Chul’s preparation and ability to lift weights began when he was 20 years old.</p><p>His motivation for embarking on this path was straightforward: he wanted to gain recognition from his peers and turn his “scrawny” body into something admirable. Chul used to do 3000 crunches a day, almost every day when he first began practicing. His workouts would often last more than two or three hours.</p><p>He later discovered, however, that this form of exercise wasn’t the most effective for building muscle, so he switched to a structured workout routine and focused on his diet. Chul’s physique started to improve dramatically after he modified his approach.</p><p>Soon has not shared much about his dating life or his marriage but it is known that the name of his wife is Yeona.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td width=481>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Wife</td><td width=481>Yeona<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Riu1-300x238.jpg></p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Children</td><td width=481><strong>Son –</strong> Riu <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/download-9.jpg><p><strong>Daughter –</strong> Not Known</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Hwang Chul Soon’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=6><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Colour</td><td width=350>Black and White</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Favorite Holiday Destinations</td><td width=350>Germany, Italy, and London</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Favorite Food</td><td width=350>Chicken, Banana, Brown rice and Shakes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Things To Do</td><td width=350>Clicking Selfies and Rigorous Exercising</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>The 37-year-old uses Instagram to share his images.</li></ul><ul><li>There are approximately 1.5 million Hwang Chul Soon fans in South Korea.</li></ul><ul><li>Hwang has shown that challenges cannot defeat your goal.</li></ul><ul><li>He did, however, appear in magazines and television shows.</li></ul><ul><li>Bodybuilding, he says, entails looking symmetrical.</li></ul><ul><li>Hwang’s physique is similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the popular bodybuilder.</li></ul><ul><li>He has massive arms, as well as wide calves and legs.</li></ul><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLXKopmip16qwHC01pqloGWTncKtew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jessica-entner-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jessica Entner Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a>
