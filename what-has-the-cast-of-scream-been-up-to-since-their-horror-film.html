Depending on if their characters survived the first movie, they typically went on to star in the sequels of the movie. Here, we look at what they have all been up to since the last part of the film came out in 2011.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Original 'Scream' Cast Will Reunite To Chat About Filming The Popular Slasher Film</a></span></p><h2 id=drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Drew Barrymore</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to ignore the performance Drew Barrymore dished out as Casey Becker in Scream, even though she was only 21 at the time. It appeared that Scream <a href=#>scared her straight</a>, as she went on to star in other movie genres including The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, and Fever Pitch. Last year, the star branched out into new terrain and started her own talk show called The Drew Barrymore Show. Berrymore has a lot going for her presently, as she is also raising her daughters, Frankie and Olive alongside her ex-husband Will Kopelman.</p><h2 id=neve-campbell><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Neve Campbell</span></h2><p>American actress Neve Campbell portrayed the role of Sidney Prescott, the protagonist of the movie. Campbell made it through all three sequels of the movie and is set to feature in the upcoming fifth part. This begs the question: ‘Is this the end of her story on the show?’ we'll find out soon enough. While the sequels of Scream were ongoing, Campbell featured in TV shows and movies including Grey’s Anatomy, House Of Cards, and Mad Men, among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is How 'Scream 5' Directors Convinced Neve Campbell To Return To The Franchise</a></span></p><h2 id=david-arquette><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>David Arquette</span></h2><p>David Arquette started his career starring hit shows including 90210, The Outsiders, and Friends. However, his appearance on Scream seems to have been his breakout role. And not only did the move shoot him to the spotlight, but it also brought him <a href=#>together with Courteney Cox</a>, who he married shortly after. After Scream, Arquette continued to pursue his acting career, appearing in films such as Never Been Kissed, Eight Legged Freaks, and Never Die Alone. In 2020, the actor shared an insight into his life with a documentary called You Cannot Kill David Arquette.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=skeet-ulrich><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Skeet Ulrich</span></h2><p>While working on Scream, Skeet Ulrich also had a few other acting gigs including Albino Alligator, Last Dance, and The Craft. Shortly after all of this, the actor was able to show the world his incredible talents as an actor. This led to him landing many major roles in TV.

He then took up the role of Stu Macher in Scream, which ultimately shot him into the spotlight as one of the actors who made their big break with Scream. He also starred in other projects shortly after, including Tarantella, <a href=#>Scooby-Doo</a>, and Mad Love. Following this, Lillard ventured into the world of animations and starred as the voice of several characters. In recent years, Lillard landed the role of Dean Boland on NBC's Good Girls and as expected, he nailed it. Presently, the star lives happily with his wife, Heather Helm, and their three children.</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Rose McGowan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose McGowan made her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debut appearances</a> in both TV and film in the 1990s playing small roles. Shortly after, she was cast to be a part of Scream, which was her ultimate big break. Over the years, McGowan has repeatedly dazzled her fans with performances in movies such as Charmed, Planet Terror, and Jawbreaker among others.</p><p>Besides being a successful actress, McGowan is also a Human Rights Activist whose focus is on helping fellow sexual assault victims. In 2017, the star was labeled the TIME person of the year by the Time Magazine, adding to her already impressive list of achievements.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Courteney Cox</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though she was more or less new to the Hollywood scene, Courteney Cox already made a name for herself before joining the cast of Scream, as she was already famous for playing Monica in the hit sitcom, Friends. In addition to that, she also made other TV appearances including Family Ties, Murder, and Seinfield.</p><p>The star reprised her role as Gale Weathers in the sequels of Scream, while also appearing in many other shows.

As a matter of fact, Winkler is still repeatedly identified from his ‘70s role as Arthur Fonzarelli in the hit sitcom <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Happy Days</a>. But this was only the beginning for Winkler, as he went on to feature in P.U.N.K.S, Here Comes The Boom, Click, The Waterboy, and several others.
