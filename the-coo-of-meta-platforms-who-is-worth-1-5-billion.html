networking site into a massive advertising powerhouse. Late in 2007, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg had a meeting. Sheryl first met Mark Zuckerberg, the young founder of Facebook, at a Dan Rosensweig-hosted holiday party. Sheryl was considered the ideal candidate for the position even though Zuckerberg didn't have a COO position in mind and didn't look for one either. Facebook made Sandberg a COO offer in 2008 for this reason and she has since <a href=#>changed the game as a COO</a>. The firm, one of the most prominent players in IT today, recently changed its name to Meta and is now intensifying its attempts to enter the metaverse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Sandberg, who recently spoke with The New York Times, she had only intended to work at the company for roughly five years but ended up staying for 14 years. The top operating officer at Facebook's parent company, Meta, Sheryl Sandberg, is resigning. According to a Facebook post by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl designed their company's advertising division, found excellent candidates, shaped their management culture, and taught him how to run a business.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Most Hilarious Moments Of Old People On Facebook" href=#>10 Most Hilarious Moments Of Old People On Facebook</a></span></p><h2 id=sheryl-sandberg-s-early-work-achievements>Sheryl Sandberg’s Early Work Achievements</h2><p>Sheryl Sandberg’s estimated net worth is above $1.5 billion, according to Forbes. She had many more opportunities than most people since <a href=#>she was a successful woman</a>. Sandberg's parents had a prosperous life. She has served as Mark Zuckerberg's right hand for nine years. While still a college student, Sheryl Sandberg formed the group Women in Economics and Government. She met Lawrence Summers at Harvard, who eventually served as her thesis advisor and mentor. At the World Bank, Sandberg quickly took on the Summers' research assistant role. From this place, her career began. In her role at the World Bank, Sandberg worked on India's leprosy, AIDS, and blindness initiatives. Sheryl Sandberg went on to get the highest award for her MBA at Harvard Business School in 1995. Right after her first year in business school, she received her fellowship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At Facebook, Sandberg <a href=#>contributed to creating the company</a>'s desktop advertising formats before helping to develop its mobile advertising strategy. Sandberg co-authored the feminist book Lean In, a how-to for professional women, in 2013 and Option B with Adam Grant, a professor at Wharton. Option B investigates what happened after her spouse Dave Goldberg passed away unexpectedly in 2015.Since she is a woman in business, many people find it challenging to take her advice on how to be successful. It is easy to preach the necessity for others to do the same when numerous people huddle close to someone.</p><h2 id=sandberg-s-key-role-in-the-success-of-facebook>Sandberg’s&nbsp;Key Role In The Success Of Facebook</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheryl Sandberg's career started anew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after she completed her MBA</a>. Sandberg first joined McKinsey & Company as a Management Consultant, a role she served for a year. After leaving McKinsey, Sandberg served as the Secretary of the Treasury for the United States under President Bill Clinton, Lawrence Summers. She helped the Treasury during the Asian financial crisis as it worked vigorously to forgive debt in the developing nations. She created a business plan that turned the social network into a massive advertising force on a global scale. She recently struggled with criticism of Facebook's user privacy policies, content moderation procedures, and business challenges. Ms. Sandberg became the company's business strategist on sales, legal and policy issues. That allowed CEO Mark Zuckerberg to focus on engineering challenges.</p><p>She built out the business side of the company, which is now one of the world's biggest advertising companies, with nearly $115 <a href=#>billion in advertising revenue</a> last year. The business grew into a tech titan, enhancing Ms. Sandberg's reputation. She gave commencement speeches, wrote two best-selling books, including Lean In, and frequently attended the Sun Valley Conference of Allen & Co. and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In Lean In, she claimed that too few women succeed at the top, in part because of the behavior of other women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becoming-a-female-boss>Becoming A Female Boss</h2><p>She planned many events where she encouraged ambitious ladies to have more confidence. It served as shorthand for <a href=#>a powerful female boss</a> who could turn a scruffy, bro-ey startup into a rapidly expanding company, as Sheryl Sandberg had infamously done with Facebook. Early on at Facebook, nearly every significant Silicon Valley business was looking to hire its own Sheryl. However, the mythology around Sandberg and what it means to be a Sheryl has changed significantly over the years as she prepares to depart the company after 14 years. She is accountable for the massive privacy invasions that support the ad business that has made Meta one of the most valuable businesses in the world and for normalizing them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is the most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">well-known female executive in the United States</a>, a role model for countless women around the world, and the one who has used her influence behind the scenes to defend Facebook — and her own reputation — at all costs. Critical events in Facebook's history can be used to chart the development of Sandberg's legacy. She revealed to the Times that she will marry television producer Tom Bernthal and that leaving Meta will allow her to concentrate on her personal philanthropy and her organization, Lean In. According to two of Sandberg's workers, she quit the company alone and informed Zuckerberg of it over the weekend by phone. Sandberg, on the other hand, will stay on the board of Meta.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Check Out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Insane Collection Of Homes" href=#>Check Out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Insane Collection Of Homes</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneur</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wall Street Journal</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6prHTZqqhnaKuuW6%2FwKebm52inHq1tMRmmqinXaSzbrnErZhmqJyWwae70aaqZq%2BYpHqqv4ywpqusmGJ%2BboGMm6ClpJmku3A%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-has-changed-since-you-last-watched-rhonj.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Has Changed Since You Last Watched 'RHONJ'?</a>
