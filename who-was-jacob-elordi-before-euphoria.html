It's been amazing to see him break out, and the road he took to Euphoria was a unique one.</p><p>Let's shine a light on Jacob Elordi and see who he was before Euphoria.</p><h2 id=jacob-elordi-is-currently-on-39-euphoria-39>Jacob Elordi Is Currently On 'Euphoria'</h2><p>Euphoria is one of the biggest shows around, and it has truly taken social media by storm. While there are many key figures that help make the show thrive, Jacob Elordi has managed to excel and make a name for himself during the show's first two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> about his character, Elordi said, "It’s funny, I don’t even really call him an antagonist, because I don’t see him as like the villain who comes in to ruin the hero’s day. Everything he does is kind of relative to his own situation. Even when it comes down to Jules — it’s because of his dad. If Rue is the protagonist, I don’t see Nate as the antagonist. I think everyone’s in their own trauma and fighting through something. And yeah, his means are fucking awful and terrible to watch. And sometimes the score makes him sound like a bit of a villain."</p><p>Seeing Elordi have this type of success has been wonderful, but he had to earn his place in the industry. Surprisingly, his big break came in a project that is wildly different from what fans are accustomed to with Euphoria.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zendaya Says Tom Holland Helped Her Film Tough ‘Euphoria’ Storylines</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-the-kissing-booth-39-was-his-big-break>'The Kissing Booth' Was His Big Break</h2><p>In 2018, Jacob Elordi got his big break in Netflix's The Kissing Booth, which starred Joey King in the lead role. The teen rom-com was a huge success, and this was the movie that got things going for Elordi.</p><p>Considering the type of show Euphoria is, it's a surprise to look back just a few years ago and see the actor in a project like The Kissing Booth. In truth, Elordi himself even had some reservations about his role in the film.</p><p>"I used to worry a lot about what people thought about me, and about the kind of actor I was because of the movies I'd made. I just felt very corny, and I felt like I had to prove to everyone that I was a serious actor. I felt terribly misunderstood," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, that first Kissing Booth film was a hit for Netflix, and in due time, it was announced that sequels were on the way.</p><p>Since that first Kissing Booth movie, Elordi has taken part in two sequels, and he has boosted his stock with his work in each one.</p><p>The Kissing Booth could not have been a better way to start his mainstream acting career, and the actor had a few other roles that helped him get to Euphoria.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Do People Care So Much About 'Euphoria' Actress Alexa Demie's Age?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-also-appeared-on-39-swinging-safari-39>He Also Appeared On 'Swinging Safari'</h2><p>In 2018, just one year before taking on the role of Nate on Euphoria, Jacob Elordi was in Swinging Safari, a comedy-drama starring names like Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the movie, Elordi played a smaller character named Rooster, and in truth, this movie was not much of a showcase for him. His role was small, and his performance was a small piece of the greater whole.</p><p>The Australian film was not much of a global hit, but it was still a chance for Elordi to get some acting experience under his belt.</p><p>Now that he has turned into a popular figure in Hollywood, Elordi's plate is getting full. Over on IMDb, it appears that the actor is attached to several projects.</p><p>He Went That Way is a movie that is currently in post-production, and Parallel is a project that is in pre-production. Both of these will feature Jacob Elordi in a primary role, and they will give him the chance to shine outside of Euphoria and the Kissing Booth movies. All goes well, and suddenly, Jacob Elordi will be more in-demand than ever before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Maude Apatow Become Famous (And Wind Up On 'Euphoria')?</a></span></p><p>The road that Jacob Elordi took to Euphoria was unique, and fans cannot wait to see what he has up his sleeve next.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think Ellen DeGeneres Made This 'Euphoria' Star Uncomfortable During Her Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecmamqiaXZq5sL7DomSbnZakv6Z5xK6noaeinq5w</p></div><div id=links><a href=./yoshi-sudarso-age-wife-sarah-garcia-biodata-brother-peter-adrian-sudarso.html>&#171;&nbsp;Yoshi Sudarso Age (Wife Sarah Garcia) Biodata, Brother Peter Adrian Sudarso</a>
