There was definitely no way to ignore that...</p><p>As her ex-husband started a life with someone else, Anna Marie Tendler continued living her creative and fascinating life. She has been more than a little vulnerable about what she has gone through while she has picked up the pieces after her divorce. Here's what she has been doing.</p><h2 id=what-did-john-mulaney-39-s-ex-wife-anna-marie-tendler-say-about-their-divorce>What Did John Mulaney's Ex-Wife Anna Marie Tendler Say About Their Divorce?</h2><p>Over the last little while, John Mulaney and Olivia Munn's life as parents has been spotlighted since they have both said a lot about what they have experienced. It can't have been pleasant for Anna Marie Tender to watch all of this unfold. While <a href=#>Mulaney and Munn have been bringing up Malcolm</a>, Tendler has gone through a lot, including losing the pet that meant everything to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Marie Tendler wrote about her dog Petuina's death</a> in an essay for Elle. She was very raw about the experience and shared that her dog helped her get through her divorce from John Mulaney.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/olivia-munn-john-mulaney-baby.jpg><p>She wrote, "Petunia and I moved to Connecticut in December 2020, in the wake of my severe mental health breakdown and what appeared to be the impending end of my marriage. We fused even more deeply together in an attuned and totally symbiotic relationship. She never let me out of her sight. In fact, she watched me intently, as if I was the thing she now needed to guard, though, where guarding once incited her primal rage, she would now guard me with the deepest kind of love I had ever known."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>John Mulaney's Star-Studded Intervention: His Friendship With Each Comedian Who Saved His Life</a></span></p><p>At the end of her essay, Tendler wrote that she had learned a lot from Petunia, and felt that she was able to find some resilience as a result of taking care of her.</p><p>She wrote, "I promised her that I was okay and that I would be okay without her; crushed, lonely, but okay. I thanked her for staying with me—for guarding me—until I was strong enough to survive without her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/john-mulaney-anna-marie-tendler.jpg><p>Tendler also explained that at the beginning of 2021, she was in the hospital because she was struggling with self-harm and depression. This was a few months before people learned that she and John Mulaney were getting divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Marie Tendler talked about her divorce</a>. She said that it made her realize that she could change her mind on certain topics.</p><p>For instance, she said that she was more interested in being in a serious, committed relationship than having children. She then thought that she might like to be a mother and said that she was looking into egg freezing. Since starting a family can be a very emotional and complicated process, it's great that Tendler shared her thoughts on the subject.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What John Mulaney Has Said About Why He Got Divorced</a></span></p><p>Tendler said, “There were things I never even thought about before because that was just a closed door.

Fans can also visit her website to see her paintings and photographs and learn about any exhibits she has. She sells her work online, along with posters and t-shirts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/anna-marie-tendler.jpg><p>Tendler's work is always thoughtful and meaningful. While of course art is always open to interpretation and people see different things in every photograph and painting, Tendler always writes beautiful captions when she shares her work on Instagram. It's clear that she loves to express herself through her art, and her fans appreciate the care and time that she puts into each speech.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From time to time, the artist also does some public speaking. In May 2022, Tendler gave a memorable Ted Talk called "Rooms in the First House." She said that the theme of the conference was "renaissance and renewal" and explained that as a child, she was interested in witches, ouija boards, and "the macabre." This was a great way for people to learn more about her as she shared a bit about what she was like as a kid.</p><p>Tendler also talked about how important it is for people to feel their feelings and to acknowledge that sometimes, it's possible to feel two things at once.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Pete Davidson And John Mulaney's Friendship</a></span></p><p>Tendler explained during her Ted talk, "You can be sad, but still laugh.

I feel amazed that so many folks feel a connection to my work and recognize their own pain, grief, joy, and triumph within it. I made this work for me, but I feel grateful to share in it with all of you."</p><p>It definitely wasn't easy for Anna Marie Tendler to get divorced from John Mulaney, and she has described the pain that she felt as a result of this experience. However, she appears to be happier now, and it's inspiring to watch her continue to grow as an artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYrq2uMCnnLJlp56zpnnAp6WaZZ2Wv6qxjK2cp5ycmr%2B0ecOooKefXaO8uHnAn6ueql2Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./leak-forum-list-of-leak-discussions-and-forums.html>&#171;&nbsp;Leak Forum List of Leak Discussions and Forums</a>
