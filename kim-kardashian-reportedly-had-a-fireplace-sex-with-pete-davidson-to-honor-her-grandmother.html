entrepreneur Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson's relationship that was off limits to the public, as has become clear again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Pete and I were staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel last weekend, and we were sitting in front of the fireplace just talking for hours,” Kim, 41, told her grandmother Mary Jo “MJ” Houghton in a new episode of Hulu’s The Kardashians on Thursday, October 13. “And I was like, ‘My grandmother told me that you really live life when you have sex in front of the fireplace.’ So we had sex in front of the fireplace in honor of you.”</p><p>The former couple's love life played out in front of the public eye, and little was left to the imagination. Now, that is more true than ever after Kim's latest confessions.</p><p>In another episode of The Kardashians, Kim made a confession that not too many people would have expected nor wanted to know.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Kim Kardashian Hired And Paid For An Extra Security At Her Kids’ School After Kanye West’s Online Attacks</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You know what's so crazy?" Kim asked her grandmother. "Pete and I were staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel last weekend, and we were sitting in front of the fireplace, just talking for hours, and I was like, 'My grandma told me that you really live life when you have sex in front of the fireplace,' and so we had sex in front of the fireplace in honor of you.</p><p>"I know that's really creepy."</p><p>Oddly, the 88-year-old's biggest concern with the news was her fear that the sex may have been had in public.</p><p>"Not in the lobby?" she asked.</p><p>"Not in the lobby!" Kim reassured. "But how creepy to think about your grandma before you have sex?"</p><p>The beauty mogul noted she didn’t expect her family member to inspire the special moment, adding, “How creepy to think about your grandma before you have sex.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the conversation, the comedian, 28, called his then-girlfriend and was put on speaker in front of Kris Jenner, MJ, 88, and Khloé Kardashian. “My grandmother says that she misses you,” Kim told Pete over the phone before asking about his planned space trip, per <a href=#><i>Us Weekly.</i></a></p><p>Kim was looking to blast off into a whole other topic entirely.</p><p>"No, I'm saying I'm really excited that he's going to space," Kim said of Pete. "Jeff Bezos is sending him to space."</p><p>As for how Pete felt about these out-of-this-world plans, Pete conveniently called Kim in that very moment and was able to give Khloe, Kris and MJ some insight on his thoughts about heading off in a rocket on Jeff's Blue Origin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My personal life is scarier," he quipped. "I can't wait to get the f--k away from everybody. I think I'm gonna stay up there, babe."</p><p>After putting Pete on speaker phone, Kim told him, "I'm with my mom, my grandma and Khloé. My grandma says she misses you."</p><p>"I miss her, too!" Pete responded.</p><p>Kris then questioned Pete about his trip, asking him if Bezos was joining him and if he had a will, should something go wrong. "I'm making one now," he joked.</p><p>When Kris asked if he was nervous, Pete responded, "Nah, my personal life is scarier, to be completely honest," referencing the then-ongoing drama between him and Kim's ex, Kanye West.</p><p>"I can't wait to get the f--- away from everybody ... I think I'm gonna stay up there, babe," he joked.</p><p>In a confessional, Kris said of their romance: "Pete is amazing. No drama, no stress, he's just Pete. [He] fits in with the family. I think Kim is happy, she laughs, she's more confident, Pete brings out the best in her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Pete's space dreams never came true. Back in March, Blue Origin took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to announce that due to a schedule change, the comedian would no longer be joining them.</p><p>And that's not the only thing that has changed since the episode was filmed. Although Kim and Pete developed a sizzling romance after sharing a kiss during Kim's episode of SNL, their relationship went up in smoke after nine months together. In August, multiple sources confirmed that the pair had called it quits.</p><p>Kim and Pete first sparked romance rumors when they kissed during a sketch on her <i>SNL</i> hosting debut last October. Later that month, they were photographed holding hands on a roller coaster at Knott's Berry Farm. Pete formally confirmed his relationship with Kim to <a href=#><i>PEOPLE </i></a>in February, calling her his "girlfriend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By August, the couple had parted ways. "Part of the reason they split was because of their busy schedules.“They both travel all the time and it was hard."</p><p>To get an inside look at their fiery romance, The Kardashians is streaming now on Hulu.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>Kim Kardashian To Pay $1.26 Million Due To Instagram Ad Illegally Hyped Crypto</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>People</a>, <a href=#>Marca</a>, <a href=#>E!
