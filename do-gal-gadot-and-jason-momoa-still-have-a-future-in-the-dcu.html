Ever since the formation of Warner Bros. Discovery under David Zaslav, the DCU has seen a lot of shakeups as of late, starting with <a href=#>the abrupt cancellation of Batgirl</a>. Since then, developments have been non-stop, with the hiring of James Gunn and Peter Safran to head DC Studios and <a href=#>the surprise comeback of Henry Cavill as Superman</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, more recently, Gunn also shook up the DCU himself after announcing the cancellation of the upcoming Gal Gadot-led film Wonder Woman 3 by Patty Jenkins. On the other hand, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman sequel is moving forward with its 2023 release. But beyond this, his future in the DCU is as unclear as Gadot’s.</p><h2 id=the-new-dc-studios-is-going-through-an-lsquo-unavoidable-transition-period-rsquo>The New DC Studios Is Going Through An ‘Unavoidable Transition Period’</h2><p>It seems that the word going around right now is that nobody is safe in the DCU. Although Gunn and Safran signed on to develop a more interconnected universe for DC Comics films and series, they are currently undergoing an “unavoidable transition period,” which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">may hint at some projects being dropped</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Peter & I chose to helm DC Studios knowing we were coming into a fractious environment, both in the stories being told & in the audience itself & there would be an unavoidable transitional period as we moved into telling a cohesive story across film, TV, animation, and gaming,” Gunn wrote in a recent tweet.</p><p>“But, in the end, the drawbacks of that transitional period were dwarfed by the creative possibilities & the opportunity to build upon what has worked in DC so far & to help rectify what has not.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To James Gunn's Secret DC Movie Idea?</a></span></p><p>And while the new DC co-chairman has not revealed their plans for the DCU yet, he did confirm that they intend to do a Superman sequel. Other than that, other solo projects appear to be in a bubble after they axed Wonder Woman 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gal-gadot-rsquo-s-hinted-on-lsquo-next-chapter-rsquo-with-dc-just-before-wonder-woman-3-was-scrapped>Gal Gadot’s Hinted On ‘Next Chapter’ With DC Just Before Wonder Woman 3 Was Scrapped</h2><p>Despite the lackluster performance of Wonder Woman 1984 following its release in 2020, Warner Bros. had gone ahead with a follow-up film. But under new management, the plan no longer appears to be feasible.</p><p>The decision reportedly came from Warner Bros. Film Group co-chairpersons and CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy. They had just received the treatment for the third film from Jenkins and reportedly didn’t like it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Henry Cavill Just Confirmed He's Back As Superman, So Is Man Of Steel 2 Happening?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And when they asked Jenkins to pitch something else, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the director declined to do so</a>. Moreover, Jenkins reportedly told Luca and Abdy that they “know that they were wrong, that they didn’t understand her, didn’t understand the character, didn’t understand character arcs and didn’t understand what Jenkins was trying to do.” Some reports also claimed that Jenkins’ email to the execs ended with a Wikipedia link that explains what a “character arc” is.</p><p>Interestingly, Gadot hinted that she was keen to stay in the DCU just before news about Wonder Woman 3 broke. “A few years ago it was announced that I was going to play Wonder Woman,” the actress wrote.</p><p>“I’ve been so grateful for the opportunity to play such an incredible, iconic character and more than anything I’m grateful for YOU. The fans.Can’t wait to share her next chapter with you”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while there is no word on Gadot’s future in the DCU, Jenkins has since denied reports about her refusal to collaborate, explaining in a tweet that she “was open to considering anything asked of me.”</p><p>Gunn also replied to the director’s tweet writing, “I can attest that all of Peter and my interactions with you were only pleasant and professional.”</p><h2 id=jason-momoa-wants-to-pursue-a-dc-project-with-james-gunn>Jason Momoa Wants To Pursue A DC Project With James Gunn</h2><p>Now, Momoa may be expected to do promotions for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom next year, but nothing has been announced about the future of Aquaman in the DCU beyond that. Momoa’s first film, however, has been the most successful at the box office, and if the sequel performs just as well, Gunn and Safran may opt to keep it around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jason Momoa Says Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom Is 'A Lot Funnier' But It Also Tackles Climate Change</a></span></p><p>Whether or not this happens though, it seems that Momoa is interested to stick around just the same, even if it means pursuing a different DC Comics character.</p><p>The actor has made no secret about his love for the DC Comics character Lobo. Prior to his casting as Aquaman being confirmed, the actor even said at a panel, “I think it would be really, really fun to play a superhero. You know? I've always talked about, like, what's your favorite. I mean I love Lobo, so ... It would be awesome.”</p><p>And once Gunn and Safran’s hiring was announced, Momoa also hinted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they may be doing something with Lobo together</a>. “There's a lot of cool things that are going to be coming up, and one of my dreams come true will be happening under their watch, so stay tuned,” the actor teased.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Gunn also urged fans to be patient as he and Safran figure out the DCU’s future direction. “I will sadly have to ask you to wait,” he explained. “We are giving these characters & the stories the time & attention they deserve & we ourselves still have a lot more questions to ask & answer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dnK6tecaam6isXZ%2ButLvNZqSopZ%2BWeqS7zKKloGWSlrCsedOoZJ2bpWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heidi-elizabeth-croft-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biograp.html>&#171;&nbsp;Heidi Elizabeth Croft Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograp</a>
