Depp first listed the property for in 2015 and 2016 with the price wavering from $25 million to $63 million. He just relisted it again last year for $55 million. Depp’s French Village has more than a dozen buildings and when it was first listed on June 2015 with the Côte d’Azur Sotheby’s International Realty, it was priced roughly around $26 million. The initial listing was taken off the market just after a few months. It was then listed yet again but with Michaël Zingraf of France-based Michaël Zingraf Real Estate and Rick Hilton of Hilton & Hyland. Both of the firms mentioned are exclusive affiliates of the Christie’s International Real Estate. Depp has <a href=#>sold about eight art works</a> by the artist Jean-Michel Basquiatt through the Christie’s International Real Estate which gave him a total of $14.6 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pirates of the Caribbean actor believes that the first listing was way below its appropriate price and it was Depp who decided to list the property for $55 million. According to Depp, the property is most ideal for the buyers who are seeking privacy. Several billionaires have already inquired about the property however to this day, the property remains to be in the hands of Depp.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Johnny Depp's Extensive Property Portfolio</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SD Entertainer</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYrewtM2nsGaclaW9tHmUbmSmoZyhtrC6jJ%2BpnqaTnXq3tculmKCdXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./adler-lawrence-karp-meet-danielle-fishel-and-jensen-karp-s-first-child.html>&#171;&nbsp;Adler Lawrence Karp: Meet Danielle Fishel And Jensen Karps First Child</a>
