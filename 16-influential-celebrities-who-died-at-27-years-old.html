Between 1969 and 1971 there were four notable celebrity deaths (which will be touched on in the following list), all of whom passed away at the age of 27. This began what is now known as the “27 club” and since then, many more remarkable talents have been taken away from us at the young age of 27. The following is a list of young, famous, talented 27-year-olds who were taken far too soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Death is an inevitable part of living. Whether you are rich or poor, tall or short, fat or skinny, each and every single one of us will eventually die. What we leave behind is our legacy, our friends, our families and the values that we instill in them, which&nbsp;is why it is so important to be true to yourself. When it comes to the deaths of celebrities, there is no doubt that their legacies will be remembered. It is heartbreaking when a talented person passes away, however it is even harder when that person is young. Most of the following celebrities' deaths involved the use of drugs and alcohol and many of them were dealing with depression and the pressures of fame. However, the world missed out on many more years of talent from these next ten angels.</p><h2 id=16-andr-s-escobar-saldarriaga><strong>16.
