The couple married in 2007 and divorced in 2008.</strong><strong>The two met on the set of the film Church Ball, where price was serving as an extra.</strong> On 2 May 2008, they made a well-publicized appearance on the show Divorce Court to air their differences in an attempt to save their marriage.</p><p>Nevertheless, they divorced in August 2008, and Coleman was granted an ex parte restraining order against Price to prevent her from living in his home when he was hospitalized after their divorce. According to a court petition later filed by Price, the pair continued to live together in a common-law marriage until his death.</p><p>However, a judge ultimately ruled against Price after hearing evidence that she carried on affairs along with other men during the time she claimed to be with Coleman, and “physically abused Coleman in public, led him around by the hand like a child and displayed no physical affection toward him in front of anyone”. In the yea 2007, Coleman was cited for misdemeanor disorderly conduct in Provo, Utah, after a “heated discussion” in public along with his wife.</p><p>After they were divorced, Coleman actually filed a restraining order against Shannon. Obviously, things had to be pretty bad for this to happen.<strong> Coleman died in 2010, he suffered a brain bleed after falling at his home.</strong> Many people have since suspected that he did not just fall, but that he was instead pushed.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-and-gary-coleman></span>Shannon Price and&nbsp; Gary Coleman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gary Coleman was an American actor, comedian, and writer who was born in Zion, Illinois, U.S. as Gary Wayne Coleman.
