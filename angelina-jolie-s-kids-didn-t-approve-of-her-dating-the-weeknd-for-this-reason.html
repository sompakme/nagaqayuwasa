"On her first evening with Jonny, Angelina only took Knox along, and they got on like a house on fire," the source revealed. "Knox is a sweet kid, and I imagine she decided he was the easiest one to begin introductions with. [Jonny is a] guy she’s always spoken so fondly about. They only hung out for a short while at Jonny’s apartment, but they seemed to get along well."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Rumors Buzz About Angelina Jolie Using The Weeknd To Remain Current">Rumors Buzz About Angelina Jolie Using The Weeknd To Remain Current</a></span></p><p>According to National Enquirer, Jolie has been linked to both Miller and The Weeknd.

"Angie doesn’t seem bothered by the song, but the kids aren’t exactly warming to Abel. They can’t make him go away, but they don’t have to like it. They like Jonny better.
