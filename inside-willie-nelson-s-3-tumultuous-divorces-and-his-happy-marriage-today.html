The outlaw country music star began making music in the 1950s and has made <a href=#>95 studio albums</a>, he's been arrested too many times to count (mostly for marijuana possession, as you probably already guessed), and he's toured the world decade after decade with no sign of stopping any time soon. He's also been married four times and is the father of seven children. How else would the octagenerian get his rugged, world-weary persona if he hadn't experienced quite a lot of life?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Willie Nelson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, And 8 Other Celebs Who Are Black Belts In Martial Arts</a></span></p><p>His lyrics range from romantic to melancholy, and he sings them in such earnest, it's easy to believe he's really experienced the depths of all of these emotions. We have to assume the four major romances in his life have something to do with that. Unfortunately, some of his relationships have been quite tumultuous and even gone into the territory of downright toxic. Despite it all, he seems to have landed on the right one, having been happily married to his fourth wife since 1991. Here's a history of the three toxic marriages that led up to that, and where he and his wife are today.</p><h2 id=he-first-got-married-in-1952><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He First Got Married In 1952</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willie Nelson first tied the knot in 1952 with Martha Matthews, whom he <a href=#>met at a drive-in burger restaurant</a> when he was 18 years old and she 16. They married soon after. Willie Nelson has described it as his first love: "<a href=#>My first full blast of love</a>, the kind of love where you lose your mind and let your heart lead the way." The marriage was abusive; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Matthews assaulted Willie Nelson</a> and suspected him of cheating on her. They had three children together and divorced in 1962. She died in 1989.</p><h2 id=he-lost-his-son-from-his-first-marriage><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Lost His Son From His First Marriage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willie Nelson and Martha Matthews had two daughters, Lana and Susie, before Martha gave birth to his son Willie "Billy" Hugh Jr. Two years after his mother died, Billy <a href=#>tragically passed away</a> on Christmas Day of 1991. His suicide changed Willie Nelson forever. They had been working on album with duets together, which Willie later released as a way to find catharsis in the loss of his son.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Willie Nelson's Son, Lukas Nelson?</a></span></p><h2 id=his-second-wife-was-a-country-singer-too><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Second Wife Was A Country Singer Too</span></h2><p>Willie Nelson <a href=#>married his second wife</a> Shirley Collie just a year after his divorce from Martha Matthews was finalized. The marriage was happy for eight years, during which time they had no children but had a thriving relationship with one another. They had previously collabored on a duet, "Willingly".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Willie Nelson Rescued 70 Horses From A Slaughterhouse And Gave Them A New Home On His Ranch</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-caught-cheating-when-his-mistress-had-a-baby><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Was Caught Cheating When His Mistress Had A Baby</span></h2><p>Though all had seemingly been fine in his second marriage, Willie Nelson <a href=#>was caught cheating</a> on Shirley Collie. She found a hospital bill from the maternity ward of a hospital in Houston that indicated his mistress Connie Koepke had given birth to his daughter Paula. Shirley Collie filed for separation in 1971 and they were divorced soon afterward.</p><h2 id=his-mistress-became-his-third-wife><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>His Mistress Became His Third Wife</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his divorce from Shirley Collie, Willie Nelson <a href=#>married his mistress</a> Connie Koepke, a Los Angeles film producer, and the couple had another daughter Amy. But this marriage soon came to an end too, catalyzed by his meeting Annie D'Angelo in 1986 on the set of Stagecoach, a film he starred in with Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings. He was <a href=#>unfaithful to Connie</a> with Annie. "I messed up another marriage," he said. "My wandering ways were too much for any woman to put up with. I'll always love Connie. I'll always love all my wives." He and Connie divorced in 1988.</p><h2 id=he-married-annie-d-39-angelo-in-1991><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Married Annie D'Angelo In 1991</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willie Nelson married his now-wife Annie D'Angelo in 1991. They had two sons Lukas and Jacob and are still happily married today. Willie Nelson writes in his book, Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of the Family Band, a joint memoir which he co-wrote with his sister Bobbie: "My love for Annie was all-consuming, but winning her over wasn't easy. She had to be sure my marriage was over and that I was truly free. She didn't care about me being a celebrity. She was whip-smart, with a keen appreciation for all forms of art. It didn't hurt that she was pretty and radiated enough energy to light up any room she entered. She also had a sharp political sense."</p><h2 id=but-paternity-surprises-weren-39-t-over-for-him><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>...But Paternity Surprises Weren't Over For Him</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite having been happily married, Willie Nelson was two decades into his marriage with Annie D'Angelo when he found out about <a href=#>another daughter he had</a> with another woman. That woman was his friend Mary Haney, and they had lost touch for decades. Fortunately, Willie Nelson and his exes and childrens are all at peace with one another and remain close as a family.</p><h2 id=he-still-considers-his-ex-wives-part-of-his-family><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Still Considers His Ex-Wives Part Of His Family</span></h2><p>Willie Nelson explained that he still cares for his exes as part of his family. "You don’t have to be selfish because your ambition and drive is for your family members as much as for yourself. Along the way you pick up wives and kids and you are responsible for them. You don’t discard them. There is <a href=#>no such thing as ex-wives</a>, only additional wives."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Ed Sheeran Did Shots Out Of Johnny Cash's Grammy With Russell Crowe</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoqScnrJuusSlqqimo2KxqsLOq5qeq12ptbOxxGafmqigrnqurdGroJqflWLBsLDAsmY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kat-von-d-news-us-weekly.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kat Von D News - Us Weekly</a>
