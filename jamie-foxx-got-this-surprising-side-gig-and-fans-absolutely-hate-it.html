The self-proclaimed "legendary global entertainment company" teamed up with an online betting company to bring its customers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BetMGM</a>, online gambling that's affiliated with big-name casinos and resorts.</p><p>The branding for the partnership rollout started with Jamie Foxx appearing in commercials, the brand's website imagery, and its social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The commercials have varied, but most aren't necessarily a positive reflection of Jamie's acting abilities or, really, a positive reflection of the industry in general.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Asking Jamie Foxx About Katie Holmes On Live TV Was A Bad Idea</a></span></p><p>One commercial shows Jamie "acting" in a scene with an actress pinned under a car. Mid-scene, his phone goes off, and he checks his BetMGM alerts as an explosion goes off in the background. Jamie hollers "we got the money baby!" and fist-bumps the actress, who's meant to be "dying," before the director asks him if he could please finish the scene.</p><p>Fans who saw multiple commercials (not by choice) weren't thrilled with them, partly because they had higher expectations for Jamie as an actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-wrong-with-jamie-foxx-39-s-commercials>What's Wrong With Jamie Foxx's Commercials?</h2><p>The first thing that bothered viewers was how the Jamie Foxx-BetMGM commercials were apparently on repeat everywhere they went. In various Reddit threads, fans of Jamie discussed how annoying the commercials were, and wondered why they were seeing them everywhere.</p><p>The simple answer is, of course, that MGM wants people to gamble so they make more money. But it's unclear why Jamie got involved with them in the first place and decided to take on the somewhat self-deprecating commercial gig.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tommy Davidson Bonded With Jamie Foxx On The Set Of In Living Color, But Hasn't Spoken To Him Since He Released His Memoir</a></span></p><p>Referencing the fact that Foxx was the spokesperson for BetMGM, one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor</a> summed up what many were thinking, writing, "man, talk about a fall and a half." Another agreed that "the notion that someone like Jamie Foxx, a role model of sorts, would be advertising it is a new low."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others guessed that he must be done with acting, seeing as the commercials were perceived as a low-level type gig for the esteemed actor. Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> mocked Jamie by adding the title, "I'm Jamie Foxx and I have a gambling addiction so crippling, it interferes with my work and passion" to a post about the commercial.</p><p>A commenter surmised, "I've wondered if he lost large amounts betting with MGM and these are paying them off." Otherwise, it's unclear why Jamie would take on the job, they suggest, leading other fans to wonder if Foxx might be having some legal or financial trouble.</p><h2 id=why-is-jamie-foxx-appearing-in-gambling-commercials>Why Is Jamie Foxx Appearing In Gambling Commercials?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jamie-foxx-in-betmgm-promo-with-vanessa-hudgens.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on various fan judgments, most people aren't thrilled about Jamie Foxx playing what they label a gambling addict in the BetMGM commercials, nor are they happy that he's promoting gambling to an audience that they perceive as already being at-risk.</p><p>Some commenters guessed that the company wanted Jamie Foxx to help them appeal to Black men who would be part of his fan base, something they see as unfair given that most minorities are already at an economic disadvantage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despite Winning A Grammy, Jamie Foxx Was Fake Singing During Ray</a></span></p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another discussion</a>, the sentiment was echoed by various commenters who were unhappy with celebrities, in general, who market to average people who don't have as much money as them. The commercials "where rich celebrities joyfully suggest average people throw their money away" are ignorant, allege fans, pointing out that other celebrities (including Vanessa Hudgens) have also appeared in BetMGM's advertisements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only that, but the BetMGM commercials weren't even done well, according to various fan opinions online. Weird camera movements and terrible acting combined made the commercials an absolute failure, said commenters.</p><p>This means there's probably only one reason why Jamie Foxx agreed to do them, given his background in mostly-decent films: the money.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-mgm-pay-jamie-foxx>How Much Did MGM Pay Jamie Foxx?</h2><p>After <a href=#>making people cry with his work on Django: Unchained</a>, fans didn't think Jamie Foxx would really stoop so low as to promote a gambling service. Given that <a href=#>he had a show canceled after one season on Netflix</a> and his career is littered with not-quite hits, maybe the money was enough for Jamie to give MGM his all.</p><p>The amount he has earned doesn't appear to have been disclosed, but with rumors of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PokerStars paying celebs like Neymar Jr. $2 million</a>, it's possible Jamie's contract is even more valuable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsButsCmoJ5llqTFuXnIp2SbnaSitK55wqikpp2imLaiuNJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shop-these-7-stylish-sam-edelman-sandals-for-summer.html>&#171;&nbsp;Shop These 7 Stylish Sam Edelman Sandals for Summer</a>
