For some celebrities, it is almost as if rehab is their version of a summer camp!&nbsp;However, all jokes aside, addiction is a real thing and celebrities seem to have a higher chance of&nbsp;suffering from&nbsp;addictions&nbsp;because they are exposed to so many more opportunities, and seemingly have endless amounts of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The world of show business is not like the real world.&nbsp;There is such easy&nbsp;access to drugs, alcohol and sex around every corner. That is just too much for a lot of stars to handle. The following ten celebrities have all suffered from sexual addiction. You may laugh, but it&nbsp;is in fact a very real thing, one that many people don't take seriously. Being addicted to sex is like being addicted to anything else, the need for it becomes more than anyone can handle, and the addiction takes over your body.</p><p>The ten celebrities which are featured in this article have all either been treated for, or have admitted to being addicted to sex. Although most of these addiction revelations happened after infidelity incidents, we will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that&nbsp;at least they are getting treatment for their affliction.</p><p>So sit back and enjoy getting to know which ten of your favorite celebrities are sex addicts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-jesse-james><strong>10. Jesse James</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jesse James</a>&nbsp;garnered some major heat&nbsp;when news came out that he had broken <a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a>'s heart. Who didn't hate him at least just a little bit? After all, Bullock is one of society's favourite actors.</p><p>Jesse James looks like a badass biker dude with his goatee, tattoos and black skulls, so he and Sandra Bullock were an odd couple from the start. The two officially separated in 2010 after rumors of his infidelity became public. In some sort of pathetic attempt to get her back, he went to rehab for what he called sex addiction. Although we are fully aware this is a real thing, we aren't 100% sure Jesse James isn't just a cheater.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-tiger-woods><strong>9. Tiger Woods</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> is by far one of the best and most infamous golfers to ever&nbsp;play. The thing about being in the public eye is that every move you make is not only watched, but is scrutinized by millions of people. Tiger Woods was&nbsp;one of those athletes that people truly looked up to, however after his countless infidelities surfaced people began to see this golf legend a little differently. Apparently&nbsp;Woods was as successful at rehab as he is on the golf course,&nbsp;and is now in recovery of his addiction. That being said, the damage is done and Tiger's image is always going to be altered by his cheating scandal, and apparent addiction to intercourse.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-charlie-sheen><strong>8. Charlie Sheen</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> is known for a lot of things, so of course he has a lot of addictions! In fact, addiction takes a new meaning when discussing Sheen! Sheen has battled an addiction to many of the more common&nbsp;drugs, as well as alcohol and of course sex. The actor is probably the most out of control person in the world and he knows it. Sheen has been to rehab several times, but he won't stop partying unless he chooses too!&nbsp;Although he seems to be a little off his rocker, something tells me that he is the kind of person that will just always be addicted to life! One thing is for sure, he is certainly one of the most interesting celebrities to write about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-eric-benet><strong>7. Eric Benet</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Halle Berry</a> is arguably one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. Imagine being married to her&nbsp;and cheating? And yet that's what happened! The world was surprised when her then-husband <a href=#>Eric Benet</a> was discovered as a cheater. The R&B singer sought help at a sex addiction treatment center after Berry found out about the infidelities. In 2004, despite his attempts at treatment, the couple split. He has since denied that he is an addict, but as most people know, denial is a big part of addiction. It is very common for sex addicts to minimize their sexual behaviour, and in the process ignore the damage it has caused to their life.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-nicole-narain><strong>6. Nicole Narain</strong></h2><p>One&nbsp;of the only females to make this list is the famous Playboy model Nicole Narain. Nicole sought help for her sex addiction in 2009 on VH1's reality show Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew. Throughout her journey, she revealed some pretty intimate details about her addiction. Narain admitted to chronic self-stimulation, which is extremely common with addicts as well as involvement in numerous sexual experiences and escapades. In 2005, a dirty&nbsp;tape with actor <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a> surfaced the web, shocking numerous people. Nicole Narain is probably not the only women in Hollywood to suffer from this addiction, but she is one of the only ones to have the courage to speak about it.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-david-duchovny><strong>5. David Duchovny</strong></h2><p>This handsome actor is best known for his role on his TV show Californication&nbsp;where he plays a sex-obsessed writer. The role became a lot more real for the actor in 2009 when <a href=#>David </a>entered rehab for being addicted to the deed&nbsp;as well. As you can imagine, he and his wife, actress <a href=#>Tea Leoni</a>, faced a lot of hardships after news of his addiction came out. Although they took a step back from the relationship, they have since reconciled. Duchovny is lucky because it is very important for couples to work together in order to get through any addiction. You just need to hope their love is strong enough to survive that tough experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-kari-ann-peniche><strong>4. Kari Ann Peniche</strong></h2><p>Kari is no stranger to having adult situations come to the public eye! In 2004, Kari Ann Peniche lost her crown as Miss United States Teen after she posed nude for Playboy.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, in 2009, she was involved in a naughty tape scandal with actors Rebecca Gayheart and <a href=#>Eric Dane</a>. Since these events transpired, Peniche has admitted to having a few problems with both substance and intercourse&nbsp;addiction, but has sought out treatment. While you may not hear as many women who battle this kind of&nbsp;addiction, it is absolutely a disease that impacts&nbsp;both genders.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-amy-winehouse><strong>3. Amy Winehouse</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Amy Winehouse</a> was without a doubt one of the most talented singers of this generation. Her tragic death in 2011 shook both her fans and the music industry. Winehouse suffered an overdose, but she also had a&nbsp;very addictive personality and had an optimistic career ahead of her. Winehouse very publicly battled her addiction to alcohol and drugs, but apparently she&nbsp;had another vice she couldn't live without. Amy Winehouse is claimed to have had a huge sexual appetite and that she had numerous fetishes. Although she died at the young&nbsp;age of 27, Winehouse&nbsp;was still able to live an incredibly interesting life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-kanye-west><strong>2. Kanye West</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kanye West</a> is by far one of the most talked about artists in the world. This self-proclaimed “legend” is married to reality queen <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and together the pair have two beautiful children. Although everyone thinks they know everything about Kanye, a lot of people don't know that he is a recovering addict. In 2009, he opened up about how he had battled a sex addiction since he was a younger teen. West is known to exaggerate, so who knows if he was really ever addicted to intercourse, but if he was, he married the right girl!</p><p></p><h2 id=1-michael-douglas><strong>1. Michael Douglas</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Michael Douglas</a> is known to be one of the first celebrities to publicly announce that he had a sex addiction. In 1990, he was admitted to an addiction treatment center which brought the idea and concept of sexual addiction to the public eye. Douglas, who married the stunning actress <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> in 2000, claims that reports of his situation&nbsp;were inaccurate. Whether he means that it was&nbsp;completely fabricated or just exaggerated we are not sure, but you can imagine that it's frustrating to have things about of your life be made up or overblown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most addicts, there is a sense of embarrassment that comes with the disease, but not all addicts have to deal with the paparazzi!</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>radaronline.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>nydailynews.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>doctoroz.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>nymag.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>huffingtonpost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWoeri0zmaZmqykobKlecCdm6KbpJ68r3nIp2StoJVir6aw0aimpmc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./andy-samberg-height-how-tall-is-andy-samberg.html>&#171;&nbsp;Andy Samberg Height: How tall is Andy Samberg?</a>
