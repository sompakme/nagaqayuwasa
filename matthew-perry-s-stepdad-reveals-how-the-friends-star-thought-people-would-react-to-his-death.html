"So, he was happy, and he said so, and he hadn't said that for a long time. <strong>It's a source of comfort, but also, you know, he didn't get to have his third act, and that's not fair</strong>."</p><p><strong>When it comes to dealing with grief, Keith spoke candidly and said that it's something he and the rest of the family struggle with "every day," and probably will for a long time.</strong> "It's with you all the time. And there's some new aspect of it that assaults your brain, and it's not easy, especially for his mom."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As hard as this moment is for the family, Keith Morrison and several friends of the late actor are focused on honoring his memory. <strong>They set up the Matthew Perry Foundation in his honor to help peoplethat struggle with the same things the actor did</strong>.
