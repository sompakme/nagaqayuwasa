"So, he was happy, and he said so, and he hadn't said that for a long time. <strong>It's a source of comfort, but also, you know, he didn't get to have his third act, and that's not fair</strong>."</p><p><strong>When it comes to dealing with grief, Keith spoke candidly and said that it's something he and the rest of the family struggle with "every day," and probably will for a long time.</strong> "It's with you all the time.
