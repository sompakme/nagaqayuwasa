During the 2020s, however, rom-coms mostly disappeared from the box office as fans turned to Netflix and Hallmark to fulfill their needs.</p><p>In 2023, all that seemed to change since Anyone But You became one of the most successful movies of the year. Part of the reason for Anyone But You's success was that fans were fascinated by reports of how much chemistry the movie's two lead actors had. At the time, Sweeney and Powell were linked to other people.</p><p>In April 2024, the movie's stars, Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, spoke to The New York Times <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">about Anyone But You's success</a>. During that conversation, Powell admitted that <strong>he and Sweeney intentionally let fans think they may be secretly dating</strong>.</p><p>"That’s people wanting what’s on the screen off the screen, and sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit — and it worked wonderfully.

According to Powell, the energy he and Sweeney shared is exactly what rom-com fans desire most.</p><p>“The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry.

After all, Sweeney made those comments right after Powell acknowledged they played up the rumors and that was Sweeney's idea.</p><p>According to The Numbers, Anyone But You was a huge financial success. The outlet reports that Anyone But You was produced for $25,000,000 and brought in $216,019,685 at the worldwide box office. The efforts to promote Anyone But You clearly were a complete success.</p><p>If Sweeney didn't believe that Powell's comments were accurate, it certainly seems like she would have disputed his statement.
