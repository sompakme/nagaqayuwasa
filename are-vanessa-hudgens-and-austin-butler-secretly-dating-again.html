of the list. But what seemed to be the perfect sweet relationship turned sour when they announced their break-up after almost a decade. However, their strong bond as a couple is what fans believe could also be a reason why they could be secretly dating each other again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Are Vanessa Hudgens and Austin Butler dating behind their fans' backs? Are they giving their relationship a second chance, or will their ship remain sunken forever? How do their fans think their relationship comeback could be possible? Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=why-did-vanessa-hudgens-and-austin-butler-break-up>Why Did Vanessa Hudgens And Austin Butler Break Up?</h2><p>As Vanessa Hudgens and Austin Butler are both successful in their individual Hollywood careers, it also became the reason for their relationship's eventual downfall. After eight years of happily being each other's partners in red carpet appearances and media interviews, the two decided to break up because of their conflicting schedules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, the two first met each other, but it was in 2011 when Vanessa and Austin started taking their feelings for each other more seriously. At this time, Vanessa Hudgens was filming High School Musical with her ex-boyfriend, <a href=#>Zac Efron</a>, so she and Austin only exchanged impressions of each other.</p><p>Six years later, the two surprised the media when the media revealed them to be a couple following their photographs of each other kissing in public.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Zac Efron And 'High School Musical' Cast Feel About Fourth Movie</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#>Elle's timeline</a>, Austin Butler and Vanessa Hudgens' relationship grew stronger despite their hectic schedules in their first five years. In March 2017, Vanessa Hudgens even posted on Instagram a photo of her and Austin with the hashtag #longdistancesucks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Between the end of 2019 and the early weeks of 2020, the couple first announced their separation to their close friends. Although they didn't officially confirm the real reason behind their break-up, fans still believe it was because of the difficulty in making their LDR and busy schedules work together.</p><h2 id=are-austin-butler-and-vanessa-hudgens-still-friends>Are Austin Butler And Vanessa Hudgens Still Friends?</h2><p>Contrary to <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens' and Zac Efron's endgame, which resulted in them cutting ties</a>, fans believe Vanessa has a relatively better break-up situation with Austin Butler. Even when <a href=#>fans speculated that Vanessa's 2020 Halloween Instagram post of her kissing a clown</a> symbolized her kissing Austin, it seems unlikely that it is true as Austin nor Vanessa ever said anything negative towards each other even after breaking up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since they have built a long and steady romantic relationship compared to Vanessa's four-year relationship with Zac Efron, she and Austin had a common denominator during and after their relationship—keeping their love life as private as possible. A source tells Life & Style that Vanessa is "cool" about Austin and Kaia Garber, Austin's girlfriend. Although it is unknown whether Austin Butler and Vanessa Hudgens consider each other friends, their rare positive comments about each other's lives and their past relationship show that they are civil with each other.</p><h2 id=what-did-austin-butler-say-about-vanessa-hudgens-and-his-break-up>What Did Austin Butler Say About Vanessa Hudgens And His Break-Up?</h2><p>It is rare for Vanessa and Austin to comment on their break-up. That is why when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin Butler cryptically responded to GQ Hype's interview with him</a> for his movie Elvis, saying, "Life is full of changes, and you've got to find a way to be evolving and growing constantly," it caught fans' attention. Austin's comments strengthened fans' belief that the two split up for their individual growth and career—not that they were holding back each other when they were still together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Austin Butler gained virtual applause because he handled interview questions about him, his current girlfriend Kaia Gerber, and ex-girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens well. So far, he has been answering them as professionally as he can in a way that he would not create any unwanted negative attention toward him or Vanessa and Kaia.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Her Modeling Fame, Kaia Gerber Was Forced Into A Career Pivot</a></span></p><p>Vanessa Hudgens has also done the same whenever asked about Austin. She would answer as short and concisely as possible to avoid further questions about their separation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-vanessa-hudgens-and-austin-butler-secretly-dating>Are Vanessa Hudgens And Austin Butler Secretly Dating?</h2><p>Although a Vanessa-Austin comeback would make their fans happy, it seems unlikely to see it anytime soon as the two of them are currently in relationships with different partners. As of 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa Hudgens is dating professional baseball athlete Cole Tucker</a> while Austin Butler is still dating Kaia Gerber.</p><p>It only took Vanessa and Austin less than a year to go back to the dating game after their break-up, and it seems like they're trying different ways to make their relationships work. Vanessa has been more open about her relationship with Cole Tucker, as seen in her interview with Entertainment Tonight, where she says, "He [Cole Tucker]'s just kind of perfect for me. I am [happy]. I am."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Vanessa Hudgens Has Said About Her Boyfriend, Cole Tucker</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Austin has leaned toward a more casual, slow-paced relationship with Kaia Gerber.
