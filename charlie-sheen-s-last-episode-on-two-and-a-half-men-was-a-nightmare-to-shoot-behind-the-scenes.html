That was especially true based on his performance. According to Jon Cryer, <a href=#>Sheen's timing and punchlines were starting to fall behind</a>, compared to what he was once capable of.</p><p>"Charlie didn’t look so good as we started our eighth season in fall 2010: gaunt, pale, sallow, even sweaty occasionally. He started talking to himself. Most of all he just looked thinner, in a not-good way," Cryer revealed with the Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>"His timing started to go off, too. He was rushing lines. Charlie just wasn’t hitting the jokes the way he used to. One time during rehearsals to choreograph the movement for a scene, he asked, “Can I just stand next to this couch?” He wanted to hold on to it for the duration of the scene."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Charlie Sheen Went Into Panic Mode When He Realized Ex-Wife Denise Richards Was Visiting The Set Of Two And A Half Men</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That was just the start of his demise, as Cryer would also admit to Sheen making poor decisions off-camera especially at that time.

It was at that point, in which things completely fell apart for Sheen.</p><p>Cryer revealed, "This official-meeting shit was the kind of thing that drove Charlie up a wall. Backstage, he was talking to himself and getting madder and madder."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Gabe and Janice, his respective makeup and hair people, were trying to do their jobs while he fidgeted and smoked. He started to get manic as he psyched himself for what he assumed was a meeting of incredible importance."</p><p>Charlie was eventually calmed by his fellow co-star Jon Cryer, but it didn't make his final shoot any easier.</p><p>"Things didn’t start smoothly once the show began. We did a scene with the two of us sitting on a couch, and Charlie screwed up every line. He could not remember anything he was supposed to say. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing because Charlie had always prided himself on getting it done on show night."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher Agreed To Two And A Half Men, But He Said Yes To A Completely Different Character Pitched By Chuck Lorre</a></span></p><p>Somehow, Sheen was able to regroup after a few brief minutes, and delivered every single line to perfection.</p><p>However, once the taping finished, he was off and never seen again on-set.</p><p>"Instead of sticking around after the taping, however, Charlie chose to walk out, still in full makeup, get in his car and have his driver take him home.

That he was far from average. He was a ninja warrior from Mars. He was invincible. And then we would drop a piano on him. We thought it was funny. He didn’t."</p><p>The Two and a Half Men finale will always go down in history among the more disappointing of all-time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZmiobamedKhnJ6mo2K5or%2FTZpypoaOksaZ5zqdkra%2BfYq6vsIyaZKGZnJt6rrHNZq6aq12Weq%2B1xqGrppmimnqjsceipZ1lpJ2ybr%2FCnqWeq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heather-dubrow-children-meet-heather-dubrow-s-adorable-kids-maximillia-dubrow-collette-dubrow-k.html>&#171;&nbsp;Heather Dubrow Children: Meet Heather Dubrows Adorable Kids Maximillia Dubrow, Collette Dubrow, K</a>
