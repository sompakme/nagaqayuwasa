Their on-screen pairing was actually inspired by the actor's off-screen chemistry, which comes from years of being friends and working together.“It’s nice to work with that lady, and you know, look at her,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Culkin told The Associated Press during a red carpet event for Succession in 2021</a>. “How? She’s so alluring, I can’t focus. It’s a joy. No, I’ve been friends with J. for nearly 20 years or so.”Forty-year-old Culkin revealed that he was “really excited” when J. Smith-Cameron was cast, as her character was “initially written to be a man,” and said their chemistry “just sorta happened on its own and grew” during production and ultimately changed how both of their characters were written.This now-iconic on-screen partnership comes after years of working together and being personal friends outside of work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-long-has-kieran-culkin-and-j-smith-cameron-known-each-other><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Long Has Kieran Culkin And J.

Smith-Cameron have known each other since at least 2005, when they both filmed Kenneth Lonergan’s film Margaret together. The pair share no scenes together. Margaret was an infamous production nightmare, although is now considered a modern masterpiece. Despite being filmed in 2005, it was repeatedly delayed while Lonergan struggled to create a final cut he was satisfied with, and was finally released in 2011.</p><p>Lonergan, who has been married to J. Smith-Cameron since 2011, has cast Culkin in multiple roles on-stage. Kieran has appeared on stage in roles in The Starry Messenger and This Is Our Youth, penned by Kenneth Lonergan. The three have been spotted together through various projects over the years with an Instagram post of Kieran appearing on Smith-Cameron's Instagram as far back as 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Succession Is Coming To An End After 4 Seasons</a></span></p><p>In 2019, Oscar-winning writer Kenneth praised Kieran in a Variety piece. "It’s hard to write about Kieran in this context because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I genuinely love and admire him, and genuinely find him aggravating</a>," he wrote. Lonergan won an Oscar for penning Manchester By The Sea.</p><p>"As for his aggravating qualities as a friend, they’re fairly insubstantial — he’s a bad arguer, he’d rather get on your nerves than make his point, he’s never seen a movie pre-1980 and constantly accuses me of only pretending to like them to show off, etc., etc." Kenneth Lonnergan married J.

Then, “I left and he looked back at me, and then I looked back at him. We missed each other.” The writers used that look as inspiration for their on-screen flirting.</p><p>“We were kind of always flirting on set,” Smith-Cameron says of her co-star in a recent interview with Esquire. “It was never for one second a real flirtation. It was that set-crush kind of thing.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does The Cast Of Succession Actually Get Along?

"I remember saying to my wife in season one, 'I really hope something happens sort of sexually or romantically between those two, but I don't know that it ever will,'" Kieran shared, referring to his wife Jazz Charton.</p><p>He simplified it to Stephen Colbert when he told the late night host, "Just trying to do a scene and whatever, we're just flirting, I don't know, J's hot."</p><h2 id=do-kieran-culkin-and-j-smith-cameron-hang-out-outside-succession><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Do Kieran Culkin And J.

You have long ears. Were they always that way? Or were they…' Still I don’t have the drink in my face. That's not -- That's early on in the dinner." But it was when Kieran took the joke too far that J. lost her cool with her co-star. "We get the check and everybody's getting ready to go," Culkin explained. "She goes, 'What’s happening? What are we doing?'" "And I take her hand, I go," he added, starting to shout. "'We're going now. We're all going home. It's 8 o'clock. Thank you so much for staying up late. We appreciate..."
