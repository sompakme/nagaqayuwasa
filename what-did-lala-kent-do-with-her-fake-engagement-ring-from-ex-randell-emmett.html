Including the "six-figure" diamond ring Randall bought and proposed to her with. Still - fans have been begging to know what happened to the ring after Lala found out it was fake. A source told People Magazine that Lala had been wholly blindsided by every new discovery about the relationship, including the falsity of the ring. All she can do is push forward and learn from her mistakes.</p><h2 id=how-did-lala-kent-find-out-her-engagement-ring-was-fake>How Did Lala Kent Find Out Her Engagement Ring Was Fake?</h2><p><a href=#>Lala shared the details of how she found out her engagement ring was fake</a> on an episode of her hit podcast Give Them Lala. She became curious about the legitimacy of their entire relationship after discovering Randall had been cheating on her with multiple women. She recalled a conversation between her mom and Randall, where the two were talking about rappers who take ugly diamonds and make them beautiful. She connected the dots and went to get her engagement ring's authenticity tested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Randall and his original jeweler claimed the ring to be worth $150,000. Upon further investigation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the diamond was actually worth something in the teens</a>. According to Lala, the jeweler she brought the ring to told said the diamond was "mostly brown" and had "been treated by one or more processes to change its color."</p><p>Never one to back down in the face of confrontation, Lala immediately reached out to the original designer of the ring, Richie Rich, to confront him about the discovery. She said the jeweler was stressed out about her discovery, then offered to make the diamond into a necklace. On her podcast, Lala said Richie confirmed that Randall knew what he was buying. "He knew the diamond he was getting. I don't doubt that for a second," said the reality tv star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where'd The Ring Go?

We don't know for sure if she ended up selling the ring to a jeweler, if she kept it, or threw it away out of spit. She did say that she planned on getting rid of the "s--t colored diamond" in some way or another.</p><p>"If I'm allowed to get rid of it, that's what I want to do. I don't want it in a pendant. I don't want this thing in my home," said Lala on her podcast. We'll have to wait to see if the reality tv star addresses what she's done with it on the next season of Vanderpump Rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On an episode of Watch What Happens Live, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lala said she had a hunch the ring wasn't worth nearly as much as Randall said it was</a> when the producer didn't ask for the ring back during their separation. "I was like, 'Something's going on with this.' I was like, 'If someone's not asking for a ring that's 150 grand, something's wrong,'" said Lala on the show.</p><p>Lala's fellow guest on the show, Summer House cast member Mya Allen asked Lala if the ring was insured or not, to which Andy jokingly asked, "For what? A Big Mac? For a Happy Meal?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Vanderpump Rules Stars Ariana Maddix And Katie Maloney Still Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn't the price of the item that made Lala upset; it was the lying.

I don't care if it was $100, I don't care if it was $100 million — I don't," she told fans via her podcast.</p><h2 id=does-lala-kent-still-speak-to-ex-randall-emmett>Does Lala Kent Still Speak To Ex Randall Emmett?</h2><p>Lala has gone to extreme extents to completely cut Randall out of her life.
