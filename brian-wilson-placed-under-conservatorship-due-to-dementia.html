<strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian Wilson, now 81, was the subject of a February 16th New York Times article, which reported that his <a href=#

January.</p><p>In that reporting, Melinda Wilson's death was cited as the cause behind the request for court intervention:</p><p>"The family of Brian Wilson, the musical architect whose genius helped power the Beach Boys, is seeking to place him under a conservatorship following the death of his wife, Melinda, [in January].</p><p>"According to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court [in February] by lawyers representing the potential conservators, Mr. Wilson, 81, has 'a major neurocognitive disorder,' and 'is unable to properly provide for his own personal needs for physical health.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Melinda Wilson had previously provided care for her husband, but following her death on Jan. 30, the appointment of a conservator has become necessary, according to the petition filed [in February]."</p><p><strong>What Is A Conservatorship?</strong> As noted above, after Wilson's wife died, his family petitioned the court for a conservatorship, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a legal and financial structure</a> defined by Investopedia as follows:</p><p>"Conservatorship is a legal status in which a court appoints a person to manage the financial and personal affairs of a minor or incapacitated person.</p><p>"A conservator may also serve as a guardian who is responsible for establishing and monitoring the physical care of the individual and managing their living arrangements."</p><p>As the Times indicated in their February article, Brian Wilson was "on the road performing shows as recently as 2022."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img

[in] February that Wilson is suffering from dementia at the age of 81.</p><p>"Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gus T. May granted the petition after finding that Wilson is living with a 'major neurocognitive disorder' and needs the assistance as the least restrictive way to address his needs.</p><p>"The judge also added a last-minute addendum after hearing from a lawyer representing Wilson’s two eldest daughters – the Wilson Phillips musicians Carnie Wilson Bonfiglio and Wendy Wilson Knutson."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Associated Press reported that "no significant objections" were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">raised during the May 9th hearing</a>, adding that Judge May described strong indicators that Wilson would benefit from structured supervision:</p><p>"'I find from clear and convincing evidence that a conservatorship of the person is necessary,' May said at the brief hearing.</p><p>"The judge said that evidence shows that Wilson consents to the arrangement and lacks the capacity to make health care decisions."</p><p>Yahoo! Entertainment noted that Brian Wilson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">consented to the arrangement</a>, and that his daughters' requested stipulations were granted by the judge:</p><p>"Two of Wilson's seven children, Carnie and Wendy Wilson from [musical] group Wilson Phillips, asked through their attorney that all the children be added to a group text chain about their father, and that all be consulted on medical decisions. The judge granted the stipulations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The two daughters had asked for a delay in the process at an April 30 hearing while issues were worked out, but it was clear at the hearing that consensus had been reached."</p><p>Unlike the conservatorships involving Spears and Williams, all parties involved in Wilson's largely appeared to be on the same page:</p><p>"In a report, Robert Frank Cipriano, an attorney appointed by the court to represent Wilson’s interests, said Wilson acknowledged the need for the conservatorship, and said he trusts the judgement of the two women.</p><p>"Cipriano's report to the court said he visited Wilson at his 'impeccably well maintained residence in Beverly Hills,' where he lives with two daughters and a long-term live-in caregiver."</p><p>Moreover, Brian Wilson's conservatorship pertains primarily to his medical and personal affairs only, not his finances, which are held in a trust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm6qZlrtuw8ilqqimXZi8r7%2FEq62arJ%2BnwKm1z2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kathryn-erbe-net-worth-therichest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kathryn Erbe Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
