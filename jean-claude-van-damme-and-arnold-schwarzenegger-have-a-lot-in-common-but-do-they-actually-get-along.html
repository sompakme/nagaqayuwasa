The most notable names who are included in that list include Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Steven Seagal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, there has been a lot of discussion about the relationships the aforementioned men had in the past. After all, it has always been very clear that all of those men had big personalities and egos, so it is fascinating to think about how they would handle competing with each other.</p><p>As a result of the interest in how those action stars related to each other, several stories about them became legendary. Some examples of that include the stories about <a href=#>Schwarzenegger tricking Stallone into making bad movies</a>, <a href=#>Van Damme trying to fight Seagal</a>, and <a href=#>Stallone losing it on Willis</a>.</p><p>While all of those stories are amazing to learn about, it is notable that none of them focus on Schwarzenegger and Van Damme. With that in mind, it is interesting to look at the truth about Van Damme and Schwarzenegger's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-jean-claude-van-damme-friends>Are Arnold Schwarzenegger And Jean-Claude Van Damme Friends?</h2><p>Over the years, there has been a lot of talk about the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone have become close friends. After all, there have been many times when pictures of Stallone and Schwarzenegger hanging out together have been posted online.</p><p>On top of those photos, there also has been a lot of talk about the fact that Stallone and Schwarzenegger feuded for years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Arnold Schwarzenegger Or Sylvester Stallone?</a></span></p><p>As a result of the aforementioned photos and the tales about Schwarzenegger and Stallone's past feud, both men have been asked about each other many times. That has given Stallone and Schwarzenegger many opportunities to publicly confirm that they've become close friends.</p><p>Unlike Arnold and Sylvester, Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme have never been as closely associated to each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/arnold-schwarzenegger-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Since Van Damme and Schwarzenegger aren't as closely associated, the two men aren't routinely asked about each other during interviews. For that reason, it is more difficult to discern the true nature of Schwarzenegger and Van Damme's relationship.</p><p>That said, anyone who wants to know about Van Damme and Schwarzenegger aren't completely out of luck since the men have given some public indications about their relationship in the past.</p><p>After years of being known for his incredible physique, Schwarzenegger started to have some issues with his health. In March 2018, it was confirmed by Schwarzenegger's spokespeople that Arnold had to undergo heart surgery to replace a pulmonary valve.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-And-His-Son-Patrick-Share-This-Wild-And-Exotic-Hobby.jpg><p>Thankfully for Schwarzenegger, his family, friends, and fans, Arnold recovered from that surgery and another procedure he had on his heart two years later. That said, it obviously is scary anytime somebody requires heart surgery.</p><p>The same day Schwarzenegger's spokesperson confirmed his 2018 heart surgery, Van Damme took to social media to wish Arnold a speedy recovery and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">state that the two actors are friends</a>.</p><p>"Wishing my friend Arnold Schwarzenegger a full and speedy recovery so he’ll be back soon! #JCVD #GetWellSoon"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Jean-Claude Van Damme Took Years To Admit To His Affair With This Music Superstar</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Van Damme directly calling Schwarzenegger his friend seems to be pretty definitive proof that they are pals. That said, that quote still leaves open the possibility that Van Damme and Schwarzenegger have a one-sided relationship.</p><p>Not long after Van Damme wished Schwarzenegger well, he posted about his relationship with Arnold on social media again. That second post came along with selfie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo that Van Damme took with Schwarzenegger</a> when the two men ran into each other at the gym.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jean-claude-van-damme-and-arnold-schwarzenegger-gym-selfie.jpg><p>While Van Damme made it clear that his reunion with Schwarzenegger wasn't planned, the two look very to see each other in the photo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Decades before Schwarzenegger and Van Damme posed for their gym selfie, the two actors took other photos together. Those photos show Schwarzenegger hanging out with Van Damme on the set of Jean-Claude's 1992 movie Universal Soldier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jean-claude-van-damme-and-arnold-schwarzenegger-on-the-set-of-universal-soldier.jpg><p>According to unconfirmed reports on the website manlymovie.net, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schwarzenegger took a jet to the set of Universal Soldier</a> to hang out with Van Damme. While that report isn't credible enough to take at face value, Schwarzenegger clearly had fun with Van Damme on the set of the movie. After all, two of Van Damme's co-stars in the movie can also be seen in the photo.</p><p>Finally, there is one more photo that seems to indicate that Van Damme and Schwarzenegger are friends which stems from the premiere of The Expendables 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dolph-lundgren-sylvester-stallone-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-jean-claude-van-damme-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>In the picture that features Dolph Lundgren, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme, all four men seem overjoyed to be together.</p><p>Of course, as actors, all four men are paid to fake emotions and there are examples of co-stars pretending to get along while promoting their projects. That said, the four actors have a history of being very forthright during interviews, so it seems very unlikely that they would fake being so happy to be together.</p><h2 id=what-are-jean-claude-van-damme-and-arnold-schwarzenegger-39-s-movies-together>What Are Jean-Claude Van Damme And Arnold Schwarzenegger's Movies Together?</h2><p>During the early-'90s, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme were both at the height of their box office powers. If the two men agreed to headline a movie where they fought each other at that moment in time, that easily could have been a massive deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger's Agent Told Him This Iconic Movie Would Destroy His Career</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for action movie fans everywhere, that never came to fruition. However, as the biggest Van Damme and Schwarzenegger fans will already know, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two actors did end up working on films together</a>.</p><p>Most recently, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme both headlined the successful movie The Expendables 2 in 2012. However, Arnold and Jean-Claude didn't appear in any Expendables 2 scenes together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Expendables.jpg><p>Before working on The Expendables 2, Van Damme previously made an appearance in a Schwarzenegger movie. In 1993, Schwarzenegger starred in the action comedy movie Last Action Hero which lampooned Hollywood. Last Action Hero featured a slew of different cameo appearances including one that Van Damme filmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As was the case with The Expendables 2, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme didn't appear in any Last Action Hero scenes together.</p><p>Back in the late-'80s, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme got their first chance to work on a movie together. In fact, the two action legends both signed on to a movie where they were going to fight each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-from-predator.jpg><p>Unfortunately for everyone involved, things didn't play out as they were originally planned as Van Damme infamously left the movie. After he was cast as the alien hunter in 1987's Predator, things went wrong on the film's set which resulted in Van Damme leaving the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnpmeYrCtrdSdnGaukaN6pa3MppxmmZ6ZeqK%2BzaijnWWjmLW4rdGznKedl5yys3nFq6CeppSotaq8jKamr6GVqHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jeremy-allen-white-gives-bts-look-at-how-he-got-ready-for-sag-awards.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jeremy Allen White Gives BTS Look at How He Got Ready for SAG Awards</a>
