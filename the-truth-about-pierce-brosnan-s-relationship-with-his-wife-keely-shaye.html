Three years after The Misfits star lost his first wife, he met Smith in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. They met at an event she was covering for a TV show.

He added that he "found a great woman" in Smith. "Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good," said the Mamma Mia star.</p><p>Brosnan's late daughter Charlotte was also sure that the pair were made for each other. "Just seeing the ultimate love that these two people have for each other was unbelievable," she said at her father's wedding at Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland. "My dad found it again, and that makes me happy."
