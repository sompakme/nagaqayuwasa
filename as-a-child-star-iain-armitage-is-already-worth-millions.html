Much like the older Sheldon portrayed by Jim Parsons, young Sheldon is highly intelligent but socially awkward, and struggles to fit in with his peers while also often finding himself at odds with his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Armitage — and the rest of his co-stars on the show — have done such a good job extending the Big Bang Theory universe, that there are those who feel that the spin-off series is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">better than the original</a>.

That is certainly the case for Iain Armitage, who began his tenure on Young Sheldon in 2017 with a salary of $30,000 per episode.</p><p>That would mean that over the course of a 22-episode season, he earned a handsome $660,000. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a> , that episodic amount was reportedly raised to $31,200 for Season 2 and later $32,500 for Season 3.</p><p>Young Sheldon was renewed for a seventh season in March 2021. Season 6 premiered on CBS in September 2022, which suggests that the consequent installment should kick off in late 2023. While the report on Celebrity Net Worth does not specify how much the young Georgian is currently earning, it would stand to reason that he has likely surpassed the $32,500 he was reportedly on at least three years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Its Massive Success, The Big Bang Theory's Producer Refused All Spin-Offs Except Young Sheldon</a></span></p><p>Young Sheldon remains the biggest job that Armitage has taken on in his short acting career, and would definitely be responsible for most of his current net worth.</p><h2 id=what-is-iain-armitage-rsquo-s-net-worth-in-2023>What Is Iain Armitage’s Net Worth In 2023?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/iain-armitage-young-sheldon.jpg><p>The very same Celebrity Net Worth piece estimates that Iain Armitage is worth around $6 million in 2023.</p><p>The actor has featured in multiple other TV shows and movies, but no other role comes close to the 118 episodes he has starred in for Young Sheldon. This would of course translate to the show being his main source of income so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Armitage’s salary on Young Sheldon may seem quite impressive, it is actually on the lower end of the spectrum for child actors in Hollywood. For example, Millie Bobby Brown, who stars in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly earns $300,000 per episode</a>. Finn Wolfhard, who also stars in the same show is said to be on $250,000 for each episode.</p><p>In fairness, Armitage is significantly younger than Brown and Wolfhard and in that sense, arguably has more time on his side. Other than Young Sheldon, he is also known for playing Ziggy Chapman in the HBO drama series Big Little Lies. Other roles that he has taken on include in Impractical Jokers, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, as well as the movies I’m Not Here, Scoob! and PAW Patrol: The Movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigmqGeYq6zucitmKCdXZ7Abq3Lq5yanKlixLC%2B06FkpqGcobawutJmqpqkkafGcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./frankie-valli-net-worth-therichest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Frankie Valli Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
