He was an English music promoter and rock and roll entrepreneur, and his wife, Hope. Sharon has a brother, David.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-height></span>Sharon Osbourne Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She stands at a height of 1.58 m.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-parents></span>Sharon Osbourne Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Osbourne’s father, Don Arden, was a rock and roll entrepreneur who managed Black Sabbath and sacked Ozzy Osbourne from the group. He was bitter with his daughter for dating Ozzy and managing his career.</p><p>While visiting her parents, her mother’s dogs attacked her and it was some time before her mother appeared to call them off. She was pregnant at the time but afterward, she lost the baby. She soon lost contact with her father and did not speak to him for 20 years.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><p>Sharon began dating future husband Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 after Black Sabbath fired him and took over his management from the Arden organization. Sharon coordinated the recruitment of a backing band, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, and Lee Kerslake&nbsp;for the recording of the Blizzard of Ozz album and helped Ozzy launch what became a successful solo career.</p><p>Osbourne had a troubled life with her father, Don Arden, who had robbed her, once tried to kill her, and who once told Ozzy that she tried to seduce Don in an effort to turn Ozzy against her. Sharon revealed she was surrounded by violence during her childhood and that it was a normal occurrence to see her father threatening someone, or brandishing a firearm.</p><p>In an interview in 2001, she commented that her father has never seen her children and that “he never will”. Osbourne had told her children that their grandfather was dead, but they unknowingly saw him for the first time when Osbourne was shouting abuse at him on a street in Los Angeles.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>When asked who she was shouting at, she replied Tony Curtis. They were reunited in 2001 and he then had a role in their reality show The Osbournes. In August 2004, Osbourne stated her father had Alzheimer’s disease and she paid for his care in the last years of his life.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><p>Osbourne’s relationship with her mother was also damaged. According to a 2009 article in The Guardian, Hope Arden was a cold woman who became even stranger after a serious car accident, something which Osbourne said “unhinged her”. When Osbourne was informed of her mother’s death, she said: “Oh, what a shame” and simply put the phone down.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-husband></span>Sharon Osbourne Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sharon Osbourne (then Sharon Levy) met her future husband Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, at the age of 18, while working for her father, Don Arden, who was managing Black Sabbath at the time. When Ozzy was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Sharon started to date him and took over his management as a solo artist.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>She once retaliated by throwing a full bottle of scotch at his head. The most notorious incident arose in August 1989, when Ozzy was arrested for attempted murder after he had returned from the Moscow Music Peace Festival and tried to strangle Osbourne in a haze of alcohol and drugs.</p><p>After the incident, he spent six months in rehabilitation as a result of his actions, after which time, Osbourne said she regained her strength in their relationship and did not press charges.</p><p>In July 2002, after colon cancer claimed the life of Reagan Erin Marcato, the mother of her daughters’ friend, then-18-year-old son Robert, Osbourne told the BBC that she had adopted Robert; however, when he was later sent to live with his father following a nervous breakdown, Osbourne denied having legally adopted him.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><p>Sharon Osbourne has only been associated with one man, and that would be her husband Ozzy Osbourne. The two met&nbsp;when she was 18 and was working with her father managing artists. At the time, Ozzy was the lead vocalist of the Black Sabbath band which her father Don was managing.</p><p>When he was eventually put out of the group, she took over his management as a solo artist and the two began dating against her father’s wishes who really tried his best to keep them apart.</p><p>On 4 July 1982, the lovebirds got married in Maui, Hawaii and their union was blessed with three kids but was also plagued with a whole lot of ups and downs especially linked to drug abuse, alcohol, and violence. At some point, it was reported that Ozzy had made his wife into a punching bag and went as far as knocking out her front teeth.</p><p>The drama between the two became a worry after Ozzy was arrested for attempted murder when he almost strangled her in one of his drunken haze. The act landed Ozzy in a rehabilitation center. Sharon once said on a show with&nbsp;The Talk Panellist&nbsp;that she had caught Ozzy in bed with two of their nannies.</p><p>After many years of endurance in their marriage, it came as a shock to many when the iconic duo announced that they were getting a divorce in 2016 after 33 years of being together.</p><p>It was alleged that Sharon had caught Ozzy cheating again with their hairdresser and could not take it anymore. However, a few months later, she announced their reconciliation on ‘The Talk’ show. Their reconciliation brought hope to many of their fans who see their union as the true definition of ‘For Better or Worse, Till Death Do Us Part’.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-children></span>Sharon Osbourne Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne have three children who are all active in the entertainment world and are doing pretty well in their various endeavors. First of the brood is Aimee Osbourne the eldest of Sharon and Ozzy’s children.</p><p>She is a musician and an actress born on September 2, 1983, in London. She is not married and has only been linked to Rai Thistlewayte in an affair that began in 2004 and ended in 2005. Her popularity is mostly based on the fact that her parents are popular.</p><p>Next is Kelly Osbourne whose life seems to be the most exciting. She was born on October 27, 1984, and is a singer, songwriter, actress, television presenter, and fashion designer. She is said to have amassed a net worth of over $15 million.</p><p>Last and youngest of Sharon Osbourne’s kids is her only son&nbsp;Jack Osbourneborn on November 8, 1985. He is an English media personality married to Lisa Stelly with whom he has three children. They announced their divorce on May 18, 2018. Jack suffers from Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis which was diagnosed in June 2012, however, he takes doses of Copaxone daily to keep it in check.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-movies-and-tv-show></span>Sharon Osbourne Movies and Tv Show<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-tv-show></span>Sharon Osbourne Tv Show<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>»&nbsp;The X Factor (UK) Interactive<br>»&nbsp;The Talk<br>»&nbsp;America’s Got Talent<br>»&nbsp;The Osbournes</p><p>»&nbsp;The Sharon Osbourne Show<br>»&nbsp;Osbournes Reloaded<br>»&nbsp;Charm School</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p>»&nbsp;Rock of Love with Bret Michaels<br>»&nbsp;Battle For Ozzfest<br>»&nbsp;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year<br>»&nbsp;I Love The 70s</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-movies></span>Sharon Osbourne Movies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Its A Boy Girl Thing – 2006</li><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span></p><li>Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties – 2006</li><li>Ozzfest: 10th Anniversary – 2005</li><li>We Sold Our Souls for Rock ‘n’ Roll – 2001</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-2019></span>Sharon Osbourne 2019<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sharon Osbourne is ready to go under the knife again. “My next surgery’s booked,” the&nbsp; star revealed on an episode of “The Talk,” adding, “I’m having it in August so when we come back to film in September, I will have a new face.”</p><p>“But I like this face,” her co-host Carrie Ann Inaba interjected&nbsp; to which Osbourne replied, “You’re just used to it, you’ll like the new one.”</p><p>The British author and TV personality have long been open about her love of cosmetic procedures, having undergone facelifts, tummy tucks, breast reduction and more in the past. “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether,” she admitted in her 2013 book “Unbreakable.”</p><p>As for why she first decided to dabble in plastic surgery, “I didn’t want to look like my mom, because I looked like my mom,” she admitted. “See, I do — I want to look like my mom,” the show’s guest co-host&nbsp;Rumer Willis&nbsp;quipped, referring to her movie star mother&nbsp;Demi Moore. “Give me the genes!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sharon-osbourne-net-worth></span>Sharon Osbourne Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2008, Osbourne and her husband were ranked as the 724th richest people in Britain with an estimated joint wealth of £110 million.
