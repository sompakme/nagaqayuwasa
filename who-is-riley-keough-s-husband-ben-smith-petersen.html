Principal photography for the George Miller post-apocalyptic action movie took place in the country's Dorob National Park. Keough was playing a character called Capable, while her future husband had been hired as a stunt performer.</p><p>According to the actress, though, it wasn't until they both traveled to Sydney, Australia for some re-shoots that they really got to connect.

According to his IMDb profile page, his first gig in this line of work was in an episode of the Australian period-drama series called Wild Boys.</p><p>He must have done some exemplary work, because within two years he had already been tapped for similar roles in the movies The Great Gatsby and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

In the 2012 film Agent Provocateur (also styled as Agent Elite), he played a major character by the name Big Phantom. He has also since appeared in the American movies Habit and Aileen Wuornos: American Boogeywoman (both 2021). In Mad Max, he was credited in the cast as Chanting War Boy and Red Flare Warrior. Smith-Peterson also has a cameo appearance in Keough's new show Daisy Jones & The Six. They filmed a sex scene for the show, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">which Keough found very awkward</a>.</p><p>In Smith-Petersen, Keough feels that she has found a balanced man she can be madly in love with while simultaneously being his best friend. "Not to say we aren't infatuated with each other; we're obsessed with each other," she said in the USA Today interview. "[But] I just always felt very comfortable with him, always wanted to be near him, even from the beginning."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuvsilnLJlm5q8trPHrGShraOXrq%2BwjJucp2Wjora1tIypnK2doqiyr3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./american-idol-final-two-talk-secret-romance.html>&#171;&nbsp;'American Idol' Final Two Talk Secret Romance</a>
